While total time consumed by now, scale:8/34371, seq_id:A000042, order:2 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A000042: 
a(n) = 0
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
