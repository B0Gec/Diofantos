 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A025608: 
a(n) = -168*a(n - 3) - 44*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -44*a(n - 2) + -168*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
