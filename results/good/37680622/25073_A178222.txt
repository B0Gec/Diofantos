While total time consumed by now, scale:25074/34371, seq_id:A178222, order:20 took:
 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A178222: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
