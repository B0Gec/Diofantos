A036118: 
a(n) = a(n - 19) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 6, a(6) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
