 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A137797: 
a(n) = a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = -2, a(5) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
