 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A099787: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) + 29*a(n - 4) - 18*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
