 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A099464: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
