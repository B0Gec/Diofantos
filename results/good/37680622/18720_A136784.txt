While total time consumed by now, scale:18721/34371, seq_id:A136784, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A136784: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 17) - 8*a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) - 13*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
