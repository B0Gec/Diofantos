 3.2 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A037633: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 58, a(3) = 292

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
