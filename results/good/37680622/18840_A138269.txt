While total time consumed by now, scale:18841/34371, seq_id:A138269, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A138269: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 4*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 53

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
