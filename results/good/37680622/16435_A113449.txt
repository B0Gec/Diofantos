While total time consumed by now, scale:16436/34371, seq_id:A113449, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A113449: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 216

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
