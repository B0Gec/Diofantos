 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A181635: 
a(n) = -1296*a(n - 4) + 216*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 216*a(n - 3) + -1296*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1296

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
