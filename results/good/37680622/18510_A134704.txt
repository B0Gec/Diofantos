 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A134704: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
