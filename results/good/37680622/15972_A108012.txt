 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A108012: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - 16*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
