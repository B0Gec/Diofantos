While total time consumed by now, scale:3183/34371, seq_id:A016281, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016281: 
a(n) = 72*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) + 23*a(n - 3) - 50*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -66*a(n - 2) + 72*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 223

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
