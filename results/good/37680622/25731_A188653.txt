While total time consumed by now, scale:25732/34371, seq_id:A188653, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A188653: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 18) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -3, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
