 3.2 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A037482: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 5*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
