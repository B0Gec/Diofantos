While total time consumed by now, scale:10656/34371, seq_id:A052102, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A052102: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 10) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
