 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A135690: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = -4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
