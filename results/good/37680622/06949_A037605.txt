 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A037605: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 191

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
