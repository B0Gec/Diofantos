While total time consumed by now, scale:25398/34371, seq_id:A181716, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A181716: 
a(n) = a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
