While total time consumed by now, scale:16360/34371, seq_id:A112261, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A112261: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -2, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
