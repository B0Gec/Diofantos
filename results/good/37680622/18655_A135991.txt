 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A135991: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 0, a(4) = -1, a(5) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
