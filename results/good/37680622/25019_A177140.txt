 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A177140: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 4) - 15*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 14*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 183

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
