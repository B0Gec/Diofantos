While total time consumed by now, scale:3154/34371, seq_id:A016250, order:20 took:
 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016250: 
a(n) = 63*a(n - 20) - 16*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 63*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -79*a(n - 2) + 63*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 210

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
