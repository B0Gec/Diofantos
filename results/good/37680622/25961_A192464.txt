 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192464: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
