While total time consumed by now, scale:6287/34371, seq_id:A029698, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A029698: 
a(n) = 10000*a(n - 3) - 3000*a(n - 2) + 129*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 129*a(n - 1) + -3000*a(n - 2) + 10000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 340, a(2) = 20860

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
