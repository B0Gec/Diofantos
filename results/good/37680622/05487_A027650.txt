While total time consumed by now, scale:5488/34371, seq_id:A027650, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A027650: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 46

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
