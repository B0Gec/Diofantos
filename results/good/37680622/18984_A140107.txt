 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A140107: 
a(n) = -2401*a(n - 4) + 1372*a(n - 3) - 294*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -294*a(n - 2) + 1372*a(n - 3) + -2401*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 490, a(3) = 6860

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
