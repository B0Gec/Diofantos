While total time consumed by now, scale:16320/34371, seq_id:A111643, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A111643: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = -34, a(3) = 136

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
