While total time consumed by now, scale:3172/34371, seq_id:A016268, order:20 took:
 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016268: 
a(n) = 132*a(n - 20) - 23*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 132*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -155*a(n - 2) + 132*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 421

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
