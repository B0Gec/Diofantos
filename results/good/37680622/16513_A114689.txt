 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A114689: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
