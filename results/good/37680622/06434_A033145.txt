 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A033145: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 81, a(3) = 730

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
