 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A081912: 
a(n) = 216*a(n - 3) - 108*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -108*a(n - 2) + 216*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 37

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
