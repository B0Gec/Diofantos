While total time consumed by now, scale:490/34371, seq_id:A103750, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A103750: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
