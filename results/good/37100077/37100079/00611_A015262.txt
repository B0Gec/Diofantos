 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A015262: 
a(n) = -1331*a(n - 3) + 1221*a(n - 2) + 111*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + 1221*a(n - 2) + -1331*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 111, a(2) = 13542

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
