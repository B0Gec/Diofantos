 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A023437: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 5, a(6) = 8

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
