a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 82*a(n - 3) + -91*a(n - 4) + 52*a(n - 5) + -12*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 15, a(1) = 105, a(2) = 490, a(3) = 1918, a(4) = 6825, a(5) = 22935

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
