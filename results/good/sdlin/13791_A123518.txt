A123518: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 166, a(4) = 671, a(5) = 2602

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
