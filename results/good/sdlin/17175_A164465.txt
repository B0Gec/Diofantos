a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 59, a(4) = 99, a(5) = 165, a(6) = 274

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
