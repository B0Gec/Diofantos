A110685: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 0, a(3) = -13, a(4) = 60, a(5) = -220

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
