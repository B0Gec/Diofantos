A073446: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 77, a(5) = 231

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
