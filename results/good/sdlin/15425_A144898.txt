A144898: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 36, a(5) = 76, a(6) = 147

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
