A226348: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -26*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 39, a(3) = 233, a(4) = 1018, a(5) = 5191

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
