A116850: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 63*a(n - 3) + -66*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 5) + -8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 41, a(5) = 119

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
