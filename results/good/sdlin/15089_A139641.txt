A139641: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -490*a(n - 2) + 3430*a(n - 3) + -12005*a(n - 4) + 16807*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 735, a(3) = 12005, a(4) = 168070

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
