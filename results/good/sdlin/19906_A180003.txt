A180003: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 3) + -38*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 56, a(5) = 247, a(6) = 475

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
