A073782: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 89, a(5) = 190

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
