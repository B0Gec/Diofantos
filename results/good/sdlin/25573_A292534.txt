A292534: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 30, a(5) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
