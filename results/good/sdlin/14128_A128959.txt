a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 5) + -10*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 82, a(1) = 810, a(2) = 8096, a(3) = 80953, a(4) = 809524, a(5) = 8095239

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
