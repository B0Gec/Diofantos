A157469: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 85, a(1) = 97, a(2) = 113, a(3) = 397, a(4) = 485, a(5) = 593

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
