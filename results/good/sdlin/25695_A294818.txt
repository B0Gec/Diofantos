A294818: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 74*a(n - 3) + -69*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 21, a(5) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
