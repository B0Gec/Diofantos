A232999: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 16, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 82, a(4) = 272, a(5) = 890

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
