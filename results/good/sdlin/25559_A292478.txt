A292478: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 19, a(5) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
