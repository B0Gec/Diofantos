A198629: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -175*a(n - 2) + 735*a(n - 3) + -1624*a(n - 4) + 1764*a(n - 5) + -720*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 45, a(4) = 287, a(5) = 1821

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
