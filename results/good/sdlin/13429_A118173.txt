A118173: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -16*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 29, a(5) = 55

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
