A292533: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 46, a(3) = 187, a(4) = 748, a(5) = 2948

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
