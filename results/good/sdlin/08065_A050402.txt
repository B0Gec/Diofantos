A050402: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 121, a(4) = 743, a(5) = 3561

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
