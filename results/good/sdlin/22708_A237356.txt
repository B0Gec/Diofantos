A237356: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 55*a(n - 1) + -700*a(n - 2) + 3186*a(n - 3) + -5180*a(n - 4) + 2640*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 1065, a(3) = 41097, a(4) = 1602289

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
