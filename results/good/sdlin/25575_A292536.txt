A292536: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 255, a(4) = 1310, a(5) = 6773

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
