A129009: 
a(n) = -39366*a(n - 5) + 10935*a(n - 4) - 270*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -486*a(n - 2) + 2916*a(n - 3) + -6561*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 18, a(1) = 972, a(2) = 26244, a(3) = 524880

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
