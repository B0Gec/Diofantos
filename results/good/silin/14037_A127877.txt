A127877: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) + 1296
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 115, a(2) = 297, a(3) = 1237, a(4) = 2171, a(5) = 5527, a(6) = 8221, a(7) = 16441, a(8) = 22335
