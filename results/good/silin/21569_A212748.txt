A212748: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 20, a(4) = 53, a(5) = 56, a(6) = 117

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
