truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + 104*a(n - 2) + -260*a(n - 3) + -260*a(n - 4) + 104*a(n - 5) + 13*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 64, a(4) = 729, a(5) = 15625, a(6) = 262144

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
