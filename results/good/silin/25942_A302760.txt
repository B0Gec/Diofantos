A302760: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 54, a(3) = 179, a(4) = 648, a(5) = 2414, a(6) = 8809

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
