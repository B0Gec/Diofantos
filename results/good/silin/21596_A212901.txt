A212901: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 28
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 26, a(4) = 45, a(5) = 66

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
