a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + 34*a(n - 4) + -101*a(n - 5) + 120*a(n - 6) + -66*a(n - 7) + 12*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 55, a(3) = 243, a(4) = 980, a(5) = 3789, a(6) = 14357, a(7) = 53832

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
