A292328: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 84, a(4) = 246, a(5) = 707

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
