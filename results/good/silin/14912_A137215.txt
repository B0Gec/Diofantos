a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 33*a(n - 1) + -393*a(n - 2) + 1991*a(n - 3) + -3930*a(n - 4) + 3300*a(n - 5) + -1000*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 355, a(3) = 4110, a(4) = 48887, a(5) = 588886

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
