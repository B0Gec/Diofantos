A026062: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 36, a(4) = 51, a(5) = 68, a(6) = 88, a(7) = 111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
