a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -50*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3) + -160*a(n - 4) + 112*a(n - 5) + -32*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 357, a(4) = 2405, a(5) = 12405

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
