A122014: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 7*a(n - 6) - 13*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -13*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 42, a(4) = 179, a(5) = 181, a(6) = 773, a(7) = 790

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
