truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -42*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3) + -150*a(n - 4) + 144*a(n - 5) + -86*a(n - 6) + 27*a(n - 7) + -2*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 245, a(6) = 804, a(7) = 2617, a(8) = 8511

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
