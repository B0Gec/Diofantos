a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -735*a(n - 2) + 6860*a(n - 3) + -36015*a(n - 4) + 100842*a(n - 5) + -117649*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 42, a(2) = 1029, a(3) = 19208, a(4) = 302526, a(5) = 4235364

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
