A156159: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 34*a(n - 3) - 2312
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + -34*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 169, a(1) = 289, a(2) = 625, a(3) = 2809, a(4) = 7225, a(5) = 18769, a(6) = 93025

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
