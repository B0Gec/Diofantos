a(n) = -a(n - 14) - a(n - 7) + 48
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 0*a(n - 11) + 0*a(n - 12) + 0*a(n - 13) + -1*a(n - 14) + 1*a(n - 15),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 13, a(5) = 13, a(6) = 13, a(7) = 23, a(8) = 23, a(9) = 23, a(10) = 23, a(11) = 12, a(12) = 12, a(13) = 12, a(14) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
