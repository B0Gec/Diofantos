A085613: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
