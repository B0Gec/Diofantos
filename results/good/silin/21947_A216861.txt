a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -65*a(n - 2) + 156*a(n - 3) + -182*a(n - 4) + 91*a(n - 5) + -13*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -2, a(2) = -9, a(3) = -44, a(4) = -215, a(5) = -1001

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
