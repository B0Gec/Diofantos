A120658: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) - 94
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 96, a(3) = 370, a(4) = 1654

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
