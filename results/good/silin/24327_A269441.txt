A269441: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 10, a(3) = -28, a(4) = 62

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
