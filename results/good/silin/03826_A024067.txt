a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -51*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 3) + -135*a(n - 4) + 96*a(n - 5) + -37*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 4, a(3) = -27, a(4) = 272, a(5) = 4651, a(6) = 38880

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
