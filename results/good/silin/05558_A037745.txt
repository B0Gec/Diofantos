A037745: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 326, a(4) = 1632

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
