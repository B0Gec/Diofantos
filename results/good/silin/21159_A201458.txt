a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 76*a(n - 3) + -98*a(n - 4) + 72*a(n - 5) + -24*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 46, a(3) = 175, a(4) = 551, a(5) = 1520

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
