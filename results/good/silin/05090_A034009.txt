a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 3) + -41*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 140, a(4) = 443, a(5) = 1268

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
