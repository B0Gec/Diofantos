A028212: 
a(n) = -5184*a(n - 4) + 2520*a(n - 3) - 450*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -450*a(n - 2) + 2520*a(n - 3) + -5184*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 775, a(3) = 13895

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
