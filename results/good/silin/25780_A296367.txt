A296367: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 360
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 200, a(3) = 516, a(4) = 1056, a(5) = 1884, a(6) = 3052

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
