a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -37*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 103, a(3) = 967, a(4) = 9079, a(5) = 85243

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
