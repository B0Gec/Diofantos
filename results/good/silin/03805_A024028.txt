a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 65*a(n - 3) + -75*a(n - 4) + 51*a(n - 5) + -19*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -23, a(3) = -216, a(4) = -943, a(5) = -2882, a(6) = -7047

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
