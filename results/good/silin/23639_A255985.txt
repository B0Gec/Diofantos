a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 49*a(n - 1) + -882*a(n - 2) + 8820*a(n - 3) + -52920*a(n - 4) + 190512*a(n - 5) + -381024*a(n - 6) + 326592*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 1, a(6) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
