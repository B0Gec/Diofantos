A213589: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 55, a(4) = 135, a(5) = 308

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
