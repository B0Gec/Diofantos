A049018: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + -35*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + -21*a(n - 5) + -7*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -7, a(2) = 28, a(3) = -84, a(4) = 210, a(5) = -462

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
