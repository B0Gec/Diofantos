A059599: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 69, a(3) = 189, a(4) = 434, a(5) = 882

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
