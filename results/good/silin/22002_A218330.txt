A218330: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2) + 512
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 175, a(3) = 301, a(4) = 1005, a(5) = 1375, a(6) = 3003

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
