A254399: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -18*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 41, a(4) = 179, a(5) = 794

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
