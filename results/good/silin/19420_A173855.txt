A173855: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1) + 72
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 12, a(5) = 56

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
