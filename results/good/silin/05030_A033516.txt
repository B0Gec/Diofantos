a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -46*a(n - 3) + 18*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 108, a(3) = 1511, a(4) = 21497, a(5) = 305184

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
