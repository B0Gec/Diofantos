A024039: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 18
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + -17*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 37, a(4) = 192

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
