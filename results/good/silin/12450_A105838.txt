A105838: 
a(n) = -398*a(n - 6) + 158403*a(n - 4) + 79002
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 398*a(n - 2) + -398*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 39, a(2) = 159, a(3) = 15720, a(4) = 63480

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
