A027608: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -32*a(n - 2) + 56*a(n - 3) + -48*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 49, a(3) = 209, a(4) = 769

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
