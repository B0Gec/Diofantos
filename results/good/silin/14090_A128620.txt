by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A128620: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 24

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
