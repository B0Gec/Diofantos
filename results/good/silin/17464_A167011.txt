A167011: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3) + -13*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 44, a(4) = 184, a(5) = 784

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
