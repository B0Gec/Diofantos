a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 38*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -68*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 405, a(4) = 4185, a(5) = 40320

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
