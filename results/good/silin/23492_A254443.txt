A254443: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 21*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 20*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 35, a(1) = 75, a(2) = 911, a(3) = 1707, a(4) = 18383

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
