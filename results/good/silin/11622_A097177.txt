A097177: 
a(n) = -10100*a(n - 4) + 201*a(n - 2) - 990
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 201*a(n - 2) + -201*a(n - 3) + -10100*a(n - 4) + 10100*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 111, a(3) = 1221, a(4) = 11221

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
