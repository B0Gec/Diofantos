A160706: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 0

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
