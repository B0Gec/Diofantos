A002664: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
