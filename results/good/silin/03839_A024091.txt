A024091: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 3) - 27*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) + 42
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -38*a(n - 2) + 52*a(n - 3) + -33*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 56, a(3) = 485, a(4) = 4032

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
