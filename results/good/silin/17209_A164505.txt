A164505: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 74, a(5) = 114

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
