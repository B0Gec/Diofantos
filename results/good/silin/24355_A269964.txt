A269964: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 1) - 4
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 11, a(5) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
