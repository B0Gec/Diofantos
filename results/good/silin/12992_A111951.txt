A111951: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 1, a(6) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
