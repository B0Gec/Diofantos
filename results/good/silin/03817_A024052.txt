A024052: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 24
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + -21*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 98, a(4) = 561

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
