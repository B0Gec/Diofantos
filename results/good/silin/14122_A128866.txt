A128866: 
a(n) = -1024*a(n - 4) + 960*a(n - 3) - 280*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1) + 1575
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -310*a(n - 2) + 1240*a(n - 3) + -1984*a(n - 4) + 1024*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 405, a(2) = 12005, a(3) = 253125, a(4) = 4617605

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
