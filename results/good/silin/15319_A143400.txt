a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 45*a(n - 1) + -835*a(n - 2) + 8175*a(n - 3) + -44524*a(n - 4) + 127860*a(n - 5) + -151200*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
