A202901: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3) + -70*a(n - 4) + 72*a(n - 5) + -24*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 93, a(3) = 494, a(4) = 2801, a(5) = 16062

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
