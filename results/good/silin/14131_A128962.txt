A128962: 
a(n) = -1536*a(n - 5) + 1280*a(n - 4) - 320*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -96*a(n - 2) + 256*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 96, a(2) = 1536, a(3) = 15360

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
