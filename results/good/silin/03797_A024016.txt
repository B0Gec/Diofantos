a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 77*a(n - 3) + -105*a(n - 4) + 91*a(n - 5) + -49*a(n - 6) + 15*a(n - 7) + -2*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -60, a(3) = -721, a(4) = -4080, a(5) = -15593, a(6) = -46592, a(7) = -117521

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
