A230579: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 341
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 32, a(6) = 64, a(7) = 128, a(8) = 256

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
