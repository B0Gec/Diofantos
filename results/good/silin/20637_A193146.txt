A193146: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
