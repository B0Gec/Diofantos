A120262: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) + 14*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 30

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
