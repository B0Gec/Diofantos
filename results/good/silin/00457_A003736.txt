a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + 149*a(n - 2) + -285*a(n - 3) + -1354*a(n - 4) + 1098*a(n - 5) + -24*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 156, a(2) = 3832, a(3) = 101476, a(4) = 2653176, a(5) = 69537644

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
