a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -60*a(n - 2) + 160*a(n - 3) + -240*a(n - 4) + 192*a(n - 5) + -64*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 67, a(3) = 764, a(4) = 5492, a(5) = 30304

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
