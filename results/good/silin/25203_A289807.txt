A289807: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 42, a(4) = 133, a(5) = 424

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
