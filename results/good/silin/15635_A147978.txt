truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -322*a(n - 2) + 1960*a(n - 3) + -6769*a(n - 4) + 13132*a(n - 5) + -13068*a(n - 6) + 5040*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = -5, a(1) = -14, a(2) = -42, a(3) = -98, a(4) = 126, a(5) = 4606, a(6) = 50478

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
