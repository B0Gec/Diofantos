a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 101*a(n - 3) + -116*a(n - 4) + 68*a(n - 5) + -16*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 82, a(3) = 406, a(4) = 1809, a(5) = 7659

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
