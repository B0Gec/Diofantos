A290929: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -18*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 39, a(4) = 114, a(5) = 330

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
