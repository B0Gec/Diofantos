A112523: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -4*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -8, a(4) = -17, a(5) = 35, a(6) = 72, a(7) = -145

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
