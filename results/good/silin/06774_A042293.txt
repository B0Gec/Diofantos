A042293: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 674*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 674*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 662, a(5) = 675, a(6) = 8087, a(7) = 8762

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
