a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 22*a(n - 5) + -6*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 58, a(4) = 208, a(5) = 750, a(6) = 2708

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
