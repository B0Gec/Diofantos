A036217: 
a(n) = 729*a(n - 6) - 972*a(n - 5) + 405*a(n - 4) - 45*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -90*a(n - 2) + 270*a(n - 3) + -405*a(n - 4) + 243*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 135, a(3) = 945, a(4) = 5670

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
