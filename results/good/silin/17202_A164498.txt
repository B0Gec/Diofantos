A164498: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 53, a(4) = 84, a(5) = 135, a(6) = 217

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
