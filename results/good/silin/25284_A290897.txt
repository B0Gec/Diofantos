A290897: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -19*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 95, a(5) = 307

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
