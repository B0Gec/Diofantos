A027963: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 47, a(4) = 101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
