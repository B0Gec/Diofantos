A128987: 
a(n) = -2048*a(n - 6) + 1024*a(n - 5) - 40*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -96*a(n - 2) + 256*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 64, a(2) = 1152, a(3) = 12288

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
