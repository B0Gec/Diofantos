A084635: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
