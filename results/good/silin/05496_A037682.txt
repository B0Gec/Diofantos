A037682: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 142, a(4) = 711

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
