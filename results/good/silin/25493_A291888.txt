truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 66*a(n - 4) + -76*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + 30*a(n - 7) + -9*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 69, a(4) = 252, a(5) = 855, a(6) = 2867, a(7) = 9339

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
