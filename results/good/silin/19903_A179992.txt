A179992: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 37, a(4) = 78

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
