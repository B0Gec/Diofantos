a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 60*a(n - 3) + -55*a(n - 4) + 26*a(n - 5) + -5*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 360, a(4) = 1870, a(5) = 9476

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
