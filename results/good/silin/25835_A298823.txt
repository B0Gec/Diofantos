A298823: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10) + -1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 21, a(6) = 21, a(7) = 20, a(8) = 30, a(9) = 45, a(10) = 44

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
