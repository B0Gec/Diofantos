a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -43*a(n - 2) + 104*a(n - 3) + -155*a(n - 4) + 146*a(n - 5) + -85*a(n - 6) + 28*a(n - 7) + -4*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 57, a(3) = 244, a(4) = 874, a(5) = 2772, a(6) = 8054, a(7) = 21920

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
