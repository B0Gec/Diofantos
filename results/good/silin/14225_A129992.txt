A129992: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 308, a(3) = 381, a(4) = 468, a(5) = 2117, a(6) = 2540

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
