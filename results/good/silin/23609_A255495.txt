a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + 189*a(n - 4) + 84*a(n - 5) + -20*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 130, a(3) = 1106, a(4) = 8575, a(5) = 62475

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
