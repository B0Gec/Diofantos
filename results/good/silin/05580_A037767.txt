A037767: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 110, a(3) = 661, a(4) = 3969

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
