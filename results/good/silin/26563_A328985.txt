A328985: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1) + 15
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = -2, a(3) = 6, a(4) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
