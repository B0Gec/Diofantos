A290918: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3) + -30*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 147, a(4) = 486, a(5) = 1566

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
