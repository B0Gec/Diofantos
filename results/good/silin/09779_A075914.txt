truth: 
a(n) = 105*a(n - 1) + -4375*a(n - 2) + 91875*a(n - 3) + -1015000*a(n - 4) + 5512500*a(n - 5) + -11250000*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 105, a(2) = 6650, a(3) = 330750, a(4) = 14266875, a(5) = 560896875

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
