a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -55*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 5) + -13*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -28, a(3) = -235, a(4) = -1008, a(5) = -3093, a(6) = -7712

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
