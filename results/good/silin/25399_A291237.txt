a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 162, a(3) = 721, a(4) = 3139, a(5) = 13504

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
