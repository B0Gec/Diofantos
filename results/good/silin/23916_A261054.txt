A261054: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 118, a(5) = 260

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
