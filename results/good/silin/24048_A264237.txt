a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -99*a(n - 2) + 226*a(n - 3) + -224*a(n - 4) + 92*a(n - 5) + -12*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 33, a(4) = 165, a(5) = 1137

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
