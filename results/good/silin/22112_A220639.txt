a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 22*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 369, a(4) = 3755, a(5) = 37320

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
