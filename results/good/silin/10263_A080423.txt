a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -135*a(n - 2) + 540*a(n - 3) + -1215*a(n - 4) + 1458*a(n - 5) + -729*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 153, a(3) = 1134, a(4) = 7182, a(5) = 40824

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
