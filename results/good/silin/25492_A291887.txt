a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 27*a(n - 4) + -10*a(n - 5) + -10*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 31, a(4) = 91, a(5) = 250, a(6) = 690

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
