A192877: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 47

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
