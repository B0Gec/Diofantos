A274772: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 66, a(5) = 149

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
