A116826: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 15*a(n - 4) + 23*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -25*a(n - 2) + 41*a(n - 3) + -38*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 244

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
