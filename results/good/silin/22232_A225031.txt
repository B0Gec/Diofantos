a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 1) + -638*a(n - 2) + 4701*a(n - 3) + -16398*a(n - 4) + 21721*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 41, a(3) = 321, a(4) = 2846, a(5) = 27961

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
