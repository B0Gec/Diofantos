A113829: 
a(n) = 4096*a(n - 6) + 441
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 4096*a(n - 6) + -4096*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 57, a(4) = 185, a(5) = 441, a(6) = 4537

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
