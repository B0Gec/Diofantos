A278815: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 109, a(5) = 416

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
