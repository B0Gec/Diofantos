A116851: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 41, a(5) = 116

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
