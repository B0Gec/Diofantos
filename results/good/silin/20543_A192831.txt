a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -132*a(n - 2) + 504*a(n - 3) + -1056*a(n - 4) + 1152*a(n - 5) + -512*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 360, a(3) = 2304, a(4) = 13600, a(5) = 76032

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
