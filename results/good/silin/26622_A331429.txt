A331429: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 35, a(4) = 91, a(5) = 189

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
