A118120: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - 6*a(n - 9) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 88, a(5) = 207, a(6) = 340

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
