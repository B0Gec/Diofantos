truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 40*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 6) + -32*a(n - 7) + -16*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 60, a(4) = 195, a(5) = 576, a(6) = 1644, a(7) = 4488

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
