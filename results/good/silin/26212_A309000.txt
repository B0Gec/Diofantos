A309000: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) - 23*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 51*a(n - 3) + -40*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 105, a(3) = 416, a(4) = 1491

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
