A027166: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -12*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 36, a(4) = 103, a(5) = 248

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
