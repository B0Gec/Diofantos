A343373: 
a(n) = 315*a(n - 3) - 171*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1) + 336
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -196*a(n - 2) + 486*a(n - 3) + -315*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3112, a(1) = 58984, a(2) = 978064, a(3) = 15345952

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
