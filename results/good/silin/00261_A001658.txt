truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + 104*a(n - 2) + -260*a(n - 3) + -260*a(n - 4) + 104*a(n - 5) + 13*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 273, a(3) = 4641, a(4) = 85085, a(5) = 1514513, a(6) = 27261234

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
