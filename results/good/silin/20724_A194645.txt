A194645: 
a(n) = -24*a(n - 4) + 62*a(n - 3) - 42*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) - 12
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -53*a(n - 2) + 104*a(n - 3) + -86*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 32, a(1) = 100, a(2) = 344, a(3) = 1220, a(4) = 4392

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
