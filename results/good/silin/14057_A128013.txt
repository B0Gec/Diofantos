A128013: 
a(n) = -31250*a(n - 6) + 18750*a(n - 5) - 3125*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -150*a(n - 2) + 500*a(n - 3) + -625*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 250, a(2) = 3750, a(3) = 42500

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
