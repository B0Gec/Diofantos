a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 23*a(n - 4) + -10*a(n - 5) + -12*a(n - 6) + 8*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 92, a(4) = 291, a(5) = 850, a(6) = 2348

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
