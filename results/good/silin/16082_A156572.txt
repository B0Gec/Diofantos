A156572: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - 35*a(n - 6) + 35*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + -34*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 289, a(1) = 529, a(2) = 1369, a(3) = 4225, a(4) = 13225, a(5) = 42025, a(6) = 139129

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
