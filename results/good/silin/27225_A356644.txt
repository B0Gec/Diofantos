a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 130*a(n - 3) + -160*a(n - 4) + 104*a(n - 5) + -33*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 360, a(5) = 2057, a(6) = 10276

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
