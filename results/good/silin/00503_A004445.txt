A004445: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
