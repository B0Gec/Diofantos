A107402: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
