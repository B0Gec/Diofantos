A305189: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 3) + 18
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 25, a(5) = 31, a(6) = 38, a(7) = 87, a(8) = 96, a(9) = 106

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
