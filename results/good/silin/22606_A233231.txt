A233231: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 10*a(n - 3) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 29, a(5) = 51, a(6) = 122

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
