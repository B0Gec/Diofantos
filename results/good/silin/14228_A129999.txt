A129999: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3) + 674
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 888, a(3) = 1011, a(4) = 1148, a(5) = 6027, a(6) = 6740

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
