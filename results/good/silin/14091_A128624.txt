A128624: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 45, a(5) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
