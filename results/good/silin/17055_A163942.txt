A163942: 
a(n) = -96*a(n - 4) + 128*a(n - 3) - 62*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -75*a(n - 2) + 190*a(n - 3) + -224*a(n - 4) + 96*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 121, a(3) = 834, a(4) = 5037

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
