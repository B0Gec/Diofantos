a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + -5*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 94, a(4) = 263, a(5) = 667, a(6) = 1577, a(7) = 3538

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
