A212971: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 25, a(5) = 48

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
