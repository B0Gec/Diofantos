A082384: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -11*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
