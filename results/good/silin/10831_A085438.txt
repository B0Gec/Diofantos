a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 56*a(n - 3) + -70*a(n - 4) + 56*a(n - 5) + -28*a(n - 6) + 8*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 244, a(3) = 1244, a(4) = 4619, a(5) = 13880, a(6) = 35832, a(7) = 82488

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
