A294817: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 51*a(n - 3) + -41*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 21, a(5) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
