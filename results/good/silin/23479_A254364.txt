A254364: 
a(n) = -120*a(n - 4) + 154*a(n - 3) - 71*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1) + 360
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -85*a(n - 2) + 225*a(n - 3) + -274*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 35, a(1) = 70, a(2) = 182, a(3) = 574, a(4) = 2054

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
