a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 10000*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 10000*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -100000000*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 110, a(2) = 10100, a(3) = 1111000, a(4) = 101110000, a(5) = 11101100000

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
