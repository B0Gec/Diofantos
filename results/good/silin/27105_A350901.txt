A350901: 
a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 40*a(n - 2) + -60*a(n - 3) + -40*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 42, a(4) = 399, a(5) = 4655

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
