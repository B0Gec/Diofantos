A006185: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 2) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 12, a(6) = 12, a(7) = 19, a(8) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
