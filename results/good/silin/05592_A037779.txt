A037779: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 54, a(3) = 216, a(4) = 867

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
