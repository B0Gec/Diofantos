A131091: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 19, a(5) = 20, a(6) = 29, a(7) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
