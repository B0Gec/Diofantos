a(n) = NOT RECONSTRUCTED :-(
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 99*a(n - 3) + -109*a(n - 4) + 63*a(n - 5) + -18*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 86, a(5) = 337, a(6) = 1299

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
