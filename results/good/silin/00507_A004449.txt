A004449: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 12, a(5) = 13, a(6) = 14, a(7) = 15, a(8) = 0, a(9) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
