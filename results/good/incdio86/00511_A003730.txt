 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A003730: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 4) - 22*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -22*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 81, a(3) = 666

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
