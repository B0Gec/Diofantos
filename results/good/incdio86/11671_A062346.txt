A062346: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 45, a(2) = 210, a(3) = 630, a(4) = 1485

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
