 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A168075: 
a(n) = -81*a(n - 4) - 27*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -27*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -3, a(2) = 36, a(3) = -189

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
