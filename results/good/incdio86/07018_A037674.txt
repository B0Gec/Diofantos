 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A037674: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 75

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
