 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A140991: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 7

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
