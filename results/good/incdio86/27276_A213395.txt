A213395: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 19, a(4) = 31, a(5) = 44, a(6) = 62

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
