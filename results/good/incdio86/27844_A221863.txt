 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A221863: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 15*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 3) - 28*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 110, a(4) = 429

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
