A200407: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 340*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 340*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 131, a(3) = 209, a(4) = 3051, a(5) = 44539

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
