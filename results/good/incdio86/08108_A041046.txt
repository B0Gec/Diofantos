A041046: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + 140*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 140*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 70, a(5) = 727, a(6) = 1524, a(7) = 2251, a(8) = 3775, a(9) = 9801
