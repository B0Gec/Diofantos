 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A037721: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 163, a(3) = 1470

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
