 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A021079: 
a(n) = -56*a(n - 4) + 106*a(n - 3) - 63*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 106*a(n - 3) + -56*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 133, a(3) = 1086

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
