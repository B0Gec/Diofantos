 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A183863: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 20, a(6) = 26

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
