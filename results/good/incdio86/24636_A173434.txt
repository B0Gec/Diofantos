 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A173434: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 4

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
