 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A136201: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
