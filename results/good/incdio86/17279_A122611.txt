 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A122611: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) + 11*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 139, a(4) = 516, a(5) = 1802

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
