 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A190577: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 105, a(1) = 384, a(2) = 945, a(3) = 1920, a(4) = 3465

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
