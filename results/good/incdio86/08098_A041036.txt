A041036: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 48*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 48*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 211, a(5) = 235, a(6) = 916, a(7) = 1151

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
