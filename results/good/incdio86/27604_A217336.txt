 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A217336: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) - 27*a(n - 4) + 33*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 33*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -27*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 35, a(4) = 345, a(5) = 1129

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
