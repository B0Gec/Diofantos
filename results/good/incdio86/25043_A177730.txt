 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A177730: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 3) - 70*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -70*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 245, a(3) = 2325

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
