A014010: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 61, a(4) = 196

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
