A053134: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 70, a(3) = 210, a(4) = 495

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
