 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A120719: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 15*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 610, a(2) = 1596, a(3) = 16500, a(4) = 97410

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
