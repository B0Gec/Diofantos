 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A183114: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 32

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
