A277723: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 31, a(6) = 37, a(7) = 43, a(8) = 49, a(9) = 56

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
