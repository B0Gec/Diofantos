 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A110550: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 4

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
