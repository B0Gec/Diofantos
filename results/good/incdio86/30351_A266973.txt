 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A266973: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
