 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A101352: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 33

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
