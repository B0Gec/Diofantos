A269112: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 33

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
