 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A176290: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 27*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -75

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
