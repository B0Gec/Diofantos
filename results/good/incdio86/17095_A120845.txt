 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A120845: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 50

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
