A213770: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 58, a(4) = 126

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
