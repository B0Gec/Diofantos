 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A131215: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 399*a(n - 2) + 399*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 399*a(n - 1) + -399*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 606, a(2) = 241396

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
