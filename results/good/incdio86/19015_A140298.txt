A140298: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 5

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
