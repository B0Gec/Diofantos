 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A027482: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 39, a(2) = 126, a(3) = 310, a(4) = 645

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
