A157371: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 0, a(4) = -55

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
