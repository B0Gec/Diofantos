 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A006096: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 3) - 70*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -70*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 155, a(3) = 1395

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
