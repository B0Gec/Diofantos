 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A284518: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 18

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
