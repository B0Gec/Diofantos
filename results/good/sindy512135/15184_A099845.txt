A099845: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 37, a(5) = 75

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
