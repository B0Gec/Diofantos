A292026: 
a(n) = -1235*a(n - 5) - 929*a(n - 4) + 1552*a(n - 3) - 476*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 1) + -504*a(n - 2) + 1856*a(n - 3) + -2048*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 66, a(2) = 1476, a(3) = 42984

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
