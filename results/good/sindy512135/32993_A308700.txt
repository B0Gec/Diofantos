A308700: 
a(n) = -34*a(n - 6) - 20*a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 4) + 44*a(n - 3) - 39*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -52*a(n - 2) + 96*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
