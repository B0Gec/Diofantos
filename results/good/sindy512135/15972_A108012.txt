A108012: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
