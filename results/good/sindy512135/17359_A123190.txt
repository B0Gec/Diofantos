 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A123190: 
a(n) = -18*a(n - 5) - 103*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) + 33*a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 34*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 3) + -108*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 6, a(3) = -6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
