A165796: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 8) + 9*a(n - 9) + -45*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 110, a(3) = 1100, a(4) = 11000, a(5) = 110000, a(6) = 1100000, a(7) = 11000000, a(8) = 110000000, a(9) = 1100000000

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
