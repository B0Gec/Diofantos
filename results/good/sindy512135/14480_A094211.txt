A094211: 
a(n) = -7108*a(n - 4) - 34787*a(n - 3) + 7605*a(n - 2) + 71*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 71*a(n - 1) + 7585*a(n - 2) + -36991*a(n - 3) + -128*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3434, a(3) = 232562

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
