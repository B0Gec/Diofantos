A158501: 
a(n) = a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 25, a(3) = -24, a(4) = 105, a(5) = -104, a(6) = 273

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
