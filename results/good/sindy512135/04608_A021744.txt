A021744: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 24*a(n - 5) + 56*a(n - 4) + 78*a(n - 3) - 65*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -89*a(n - 2) + 194*a(n - 3) + -120*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 167, a(3) = 1442

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
