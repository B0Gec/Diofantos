A021714: 
a(n) = 55*a(n - 5) + 140*a(n - 4) + 245*a(n - 3) - 161*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -197*a(n - 2) + 503*a(n - 3) + -330*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 428, a(3) = 6278

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
