A028013: 
a(n) = -970*a(n - 5) - 880*a(n - 4) + 1197*a(n - 3) - 314*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -332*a(n - 2) + 1388*a(n - 3) + -1680*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 629, a(3) = 10595

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
