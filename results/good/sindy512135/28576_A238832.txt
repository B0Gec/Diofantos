A238832: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 9, a(6) = 23, a(7) = 58, a(8) = 141

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
