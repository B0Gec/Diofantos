A136433: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 15) - 3*a(n - 9) + a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + -6*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 79, a(4) = 81, a(5) = 163, a(6) = 491, a(7) = 492, a(8) = 986

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
