A025972: 
a(n) = -321*a(n - 5) - 181*a(n - 4) + 400*a(n - 3) - 153*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -167*a(n - 2) + 506*a(n - 3) + -504*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 317, a(3) = 3806

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
