A021274: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 5) + 83*a(n - 4) + 98*a(n - 3) - 112*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -147*a(n - 2) + 302*a(n - 3) + -176*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 337, a(3) = 4482

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
