A015277: 
a(n) = 649*a(n - 3) + 59050*a(n - 2) - 648*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -656*a(n - 1) + 53874*a(n - 2) + 478224*a(n - 3) + -531441*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -656, a(2) = 484210, a(3) = -352504880

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
