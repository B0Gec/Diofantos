A028044: 
a(n) = -562*a(n - 5) - 506*a(n - 4) + 648*a(n - 3) - 203*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -218*a(n - 2) + 776*a(n - 3) + -960*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 407, a(3) = 5501

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
