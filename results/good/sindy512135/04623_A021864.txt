A021864: 
a(n) = 38*a(n - 5) + 106*a(n - 4) + 192*a(n - 3) - 117*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -147*a(n - 2) + 379*a(n - 3) + -252*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 294, a(3) = 3466

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
