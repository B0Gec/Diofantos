A025951: 
a(n) = -371*a(n - 5) - 190*a(n - 4) + 470*a(n - 3) - 186*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -202*a(n - 2) + 600*a(n - 3) + -576*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 423, a(3) = 6125

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
