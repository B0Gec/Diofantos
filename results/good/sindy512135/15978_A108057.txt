A108057: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -6, a(4) = 7, a(5) = -9, a(6) = 10, a(7) = -11, a(8) = 13, a(9) = -16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
