A100575: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
