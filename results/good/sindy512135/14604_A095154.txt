A095154: 
a(n) = -4601*a(n - 5) - 7287*a(n - 4) + 5210*a(n - 3) - 922*a(n - 2) + 56*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 57*a(n - 1) + -1002*a(n - 2) + 6562*a(n - 3) + -15381*a(n - 4) + 9765*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 21, a(1) = 2919, a(2) = 155106, a(3) = 6054006, a(4) = 208493607

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
