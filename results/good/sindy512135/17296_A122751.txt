A122751: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -3*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 29, a(5) = 49, a(6) = 83, a(7) = 127, a(8) = 192

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
