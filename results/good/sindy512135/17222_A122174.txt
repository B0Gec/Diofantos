A122174: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -13*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -4, a(2) = 6, a(3) = -24, a(4) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
