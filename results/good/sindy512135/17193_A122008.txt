 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A122008: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
