A213748: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) + 19*a(n - 4) + 23*a(n - 3) - 30*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -53*a(n - 2) + 106*a(n - 3) + -96*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 125, a(3) = 758, a(4) = 4071

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
