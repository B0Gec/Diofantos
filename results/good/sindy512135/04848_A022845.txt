A022845: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 5) + 164*a(n - 4) + 377*a(n - 3) - 175*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -209*a(n - 2) + 635*a(n - 3) + -450*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 416, a(3) = 5810

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
