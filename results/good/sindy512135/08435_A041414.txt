A041414: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 298*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 298*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 14, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 134, a(3) = 149, a(4) = 4306, a(5) = 4455, a(6) = 39946, a(7) = 44401

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
