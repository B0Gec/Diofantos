While total time consumed by now, scale:4357/34371, seq_id:A020000, order:20 took:
 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A020000: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 5) + 146*a(n - 4) + 316*a(n - 3) - 157*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -167*a(n - 2) + 385*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 362

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
