A113250: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 6) - 60*a(n - 5) + 240*a(n - 4) + 64*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + 256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
