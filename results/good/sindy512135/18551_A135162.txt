A135162: 
a(n) = -94*a(n - 6) - 96*a(n - 5) - 12*a(n - 4) + 155*a(n - 3) - 85*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -101*a(n - 2) + 247*a(n - 3) + -210*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 199

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
