A023949: 
a(n) = 38*a(n - 5) + 128*a(n - 4) + 275*a(n - 3) - 137*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -167*a(n - 2) + 482*a(n - 3) + -336*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 317, a(3) = 3782

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
