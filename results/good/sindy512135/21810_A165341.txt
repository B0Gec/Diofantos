A165341: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + 17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + 17*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 5) + 17*a(n - 6) + 17*a(n - 7) + 17*a(n - 8) + -153*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 342, a(3) = 6156, a(4) = 110808, a(5) = 1994544, a(6) = 35901792, a(7) = 646232256, a(8) = 11632180608
