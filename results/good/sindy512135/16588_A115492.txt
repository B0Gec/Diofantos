A115492: 
a(n) = -2369*a(n - 5) - 2097*a(n - 4) + 2989*a(n - 3) - 777*a(n - 2) + 53*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 54*a(n - 1) + -808*a(n - 2) + 3456*a(n - 3) + -4096*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 35, a(1) = 1134, a(2) = 34748, a(3) = 1081080

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
