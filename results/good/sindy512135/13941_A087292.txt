A087292: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 25*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 384

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
