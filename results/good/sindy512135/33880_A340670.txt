A340670: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
