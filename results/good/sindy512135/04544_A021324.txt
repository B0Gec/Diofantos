A021324: 
a(n) = 61*a(n - 5) + 112*a(n - 4) + 141*a(n - 3) - 149*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -188*a(n - 2) + 404*a(n - 3) + -240*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 437, a(3) = 6629

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
