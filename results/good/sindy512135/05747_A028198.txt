A028198: 
a(n) = -2517*a(n - 5) - 4718*a(n - 4) + 2672*a(n - 3) - 483*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37*a(n - 1) + -499*a(n - 2) + 2883*a(n - 3) + -5940*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 870, a(3) = 16610

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
