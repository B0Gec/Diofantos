A025030: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 140, a(4) = 658, a(5) = 3164, a(6) = 15106

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
