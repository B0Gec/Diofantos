A025977: 
a(n) = -402*a(n - 5) - 248*a(n - 4) + 501*a(n - 3) - 181*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -196*a(n - 2) + 624*a(n - 3) + -640*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 380, a(3) = 5040

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
