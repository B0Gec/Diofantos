A193041: 
a(n) = -a(n - 14) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 44, a(5) = 122

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
