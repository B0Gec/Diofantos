A225029: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 6) + 22*a(n - 5) + 35*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 3) - 48*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -59*a(n - 2) + 74*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 103

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
