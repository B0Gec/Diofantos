A021894: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 5) + 136*a(n - 4) + 264*a(n - 3) - 149*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -183*a(n - 2) + 496*a(n - 3) + -336*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 393, a(3) = 5536

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
