A028127: 
a(n) = -1130*a(n - 5) - 1475*a(n - 4) + 1246*a(n - 3) - 304*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -319*a(n - 2) + 1410*a(n - 3) + -2200*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 581, a(3) = 9270

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
