A106233: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
