A123894: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + 105*a(n - 5) + -50*a(n - 6) + 100*a(n - 7) + -24*a(n - 8) + 24*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 115, a(4) = 525, a(5) = 2405, a(6) = 11025, a(7) = 50525, a(8) = 231525

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
