A211630: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 106, a(4) = 252, a(5) = 495, a(6) = 855, a(7) = 1359

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
