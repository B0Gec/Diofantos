A211704: 
a(n) = 0
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10) + -1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 13, a(6) = 14, a(7) = 17, a(8) = 19, a(9) = 22, a(10) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
