 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A083445: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 5) + 31*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 93*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -109*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 18, a(1) = 270, a(2) = 3438

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
