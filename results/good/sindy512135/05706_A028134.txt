A028134: 
a(n) = -1039*a(n - 5) - 1348*a(n - 4) + 1142*a(n - 3) - 283*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -298*a(n - 2) + 1296*a(n - 3) + -2016*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 543, a(3) = 8401

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
