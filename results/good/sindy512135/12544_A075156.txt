A075156: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 70

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
