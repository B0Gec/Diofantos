A284838: 
a(n) = -1578*a(n - 5) - 2053*a(n - 4) + 1762*a(n - 3) - 414*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -432*a(n - 2) + 1984*a(n - 3) + -3072*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 40, a(2) = 1088, a(3) = 21888

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
