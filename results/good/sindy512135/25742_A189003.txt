A189003: 
a(n) = -23*a(n - 4) + 14*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -32*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 95, a(5) = 192, a(6) = 1183, a(7) = 2415

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
