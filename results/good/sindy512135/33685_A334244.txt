A334244: 
a(n) = 4096*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 64*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -64*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 81, a(3) = 959, a(4) = 5185, a(5) = 61391

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
