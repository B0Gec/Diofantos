A106627: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 105, a(5) = 286, a(6) = 918, a(7) = 2871

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
