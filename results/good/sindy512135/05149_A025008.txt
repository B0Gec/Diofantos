A025008: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 5) + 297*a(n - 4) + 963*a(n - 3) - 307*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -347*a(n - 2) + 1372*a(n - 3) + -1056*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 677, a(3) = 11932

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
