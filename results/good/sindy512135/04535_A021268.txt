A021268: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 5) + 76*a(n - 4) + 87*a(n - 3) - 103*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -136*a(n - 2) + 276*a(n - 3) + -160*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 305, a(3) = 3825

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
