A027946: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -9*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
