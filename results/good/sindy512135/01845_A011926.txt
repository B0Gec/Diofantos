A011926: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -10*a(n - 6) + 10*a(n - 7) + -5*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 7, a(6) = 22, a(7) = 52, a(8) = 105

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
