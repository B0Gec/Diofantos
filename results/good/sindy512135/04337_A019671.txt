 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A019671: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 5) + 129*a(n - 4) + 252*a(n - 3) - 142*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -152*a(n - 2) + 320*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 332

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
