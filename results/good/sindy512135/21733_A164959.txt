A164959: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + 22*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + 22*a(n - 4) + 22*a(n - 5) + 22*a(n - 6) + 22*a(n - 7) + -253*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 552, a(3) = 12696, a(4) = 292008, a(5) = 6716184, a(6) = 154472232, a(7) = 3552861336

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
