A292535: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 189, a(4) = 909, a(5) = 4368

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
