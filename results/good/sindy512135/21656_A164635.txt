A164635: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + 20*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 6) + -210*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 462, a(3) = 9702, a(4) = 203742, a(5) = 4278582, a(6) = 89850222

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
