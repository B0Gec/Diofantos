A167603: 
a(n) = 138*a(n - 3) - 91330*a(n - 2) - 757*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -837*a(n - 1) + -277760*a(n - 2) + -83891456*a(n - 3) + -7809531904*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -837, a(2) = 422809, a(3) = -205297469

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
