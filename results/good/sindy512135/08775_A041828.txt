A041828: 
a(n) = 185*a(n - 8) + 291*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 292*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 20, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 125, a(3) = 146, a(4) = 5965, a(5) = 6111, a(6) = 36520, a(7) = 42631

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
