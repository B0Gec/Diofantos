A026795: 
a(n) = -645*a(n - 5) - 514*a(n - 4) + 796*a(n - 3) - 238*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -254*a(n - 2) + 948*a(n - 3) + -1080*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 475, a(3) = 6915

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
