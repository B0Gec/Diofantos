A221075: 
a(n) = -14*a(n - 8) + 15*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -14*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 192, a(6) = 1, a(7) = 360, a(8) = 1, a(9) = 2700

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
