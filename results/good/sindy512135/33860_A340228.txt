A340228: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
