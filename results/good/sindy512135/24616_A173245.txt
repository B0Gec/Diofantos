A173245: 
a(n) = a(n - 11)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 75, a(4) = 90, a(5) = 42, a(6) = -42, a(7) = -90, a(8) = -75, a(9) = -35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
