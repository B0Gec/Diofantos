A084847: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 6) + 15*a(n - 5) + 24*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) - 31*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 48*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
