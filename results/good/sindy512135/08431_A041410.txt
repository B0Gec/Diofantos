A041410: 
a(n) = 178*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 178*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 14, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 74, a(3) = 89, a(4) = 2566, a(5) = 2655, a(6) = 13186, a(7) = 15841

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
