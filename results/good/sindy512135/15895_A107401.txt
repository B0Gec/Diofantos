A107401: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 18) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
