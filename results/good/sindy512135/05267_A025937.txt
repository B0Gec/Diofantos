A025937: 
a(n) = -110*a(n - 6) - 117*a(n - 5) - 23*a(n - 4) + 187*a(n - 3) - 96*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -113*a(n - 2) + 288*a(n - 3) + -252*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 211, a(3) = 2052

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
