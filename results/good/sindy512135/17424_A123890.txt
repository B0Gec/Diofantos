A123890: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -5*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 115, a(4) = 525, a(5) = 2385, a(6) = 10825, a(7) = 49120, a(8) = 222875

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
