A047790: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
