 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A016309: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 6) + 40*a(n - 5) + 67*a(n - 4) + 72*a(n - 3) - 94*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -108*a(n - 2) + 144*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 292

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
