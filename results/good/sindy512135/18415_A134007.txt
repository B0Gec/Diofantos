A134007: 
a(n) = 946*a(n - 5) - 1690*a(n - 4) + 950*a(n - 3) - 230*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -230*a(n - 2) + 950*a(n - 3) + -1689*a(n - 4) + 945*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 165, a(3) = 1225, a(4) = 9669

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
