A017644: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 10000, a(1) = 234256, a(2) = 1336336, a(3) = 4477456, a(4) = 11316496

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
