A028041: 
a(n) = -544*a(n - 5) - 480*a(n - 4) + 628*a(n - 3) - 200*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -215*a(n - 2) + 755*a(n - 3) + -924*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 410, a(3) = 5630

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
