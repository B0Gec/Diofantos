A121960: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - 14*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + -16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 59, a(3) = 237, a(4) = 698

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
