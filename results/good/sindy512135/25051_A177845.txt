A177845: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 775, a(1) = 8919, a(2) = 34223

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
