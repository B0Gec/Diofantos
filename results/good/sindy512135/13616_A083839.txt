A083839: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 11, a(6) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
