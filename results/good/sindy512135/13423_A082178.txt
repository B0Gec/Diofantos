a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) - 4070*a(n - 3) - 5500884*a(n - 2) + 4566*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7266*a(n - 1) + -19690571*a(n - 2) + 23585007306*a(n - 3) + -10533473613720*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 10899

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
