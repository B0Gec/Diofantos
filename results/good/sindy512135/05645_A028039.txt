A028039: 
a(n) = -451*a(n - 5) - 378*a(n - 4) + 521*a(n - 3) - 173*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -187*a(n - 2) + 633*a(n - 3) + -756*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 342, a(3) = 4198

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
