A111663: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -2*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 32, a(6) = 62, a(7) = 124, a(8) = 248, a(9) = 494

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
