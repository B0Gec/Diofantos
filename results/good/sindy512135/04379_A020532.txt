A020532: 
a(n) = 63*a(n - 6) + 124*a(n - 5) + 228*a(n - 4) + 308*a(n - 3) - 309*a(n - 2) + 41*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -336*a(n - 2) + 512*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 70, a(2) = 1292

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
