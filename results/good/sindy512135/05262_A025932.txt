A025932: 
a(n) = -106*a(n - 6) - 111*a(n - 5) - 18*a(n - 4) + 178*a(n - 3) - 94*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -111*a(n - 2) + 278*a(n - 3) + -240*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 213, a(3) = 2114

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
