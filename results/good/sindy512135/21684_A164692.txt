A164692: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 45*a(n - 1) + 45*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3) + 45*a(n - 4) + 45*a(n - 5) + 45*a(n - 6) + -1035*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 47, a(2) = 2162, a(3) = 99452, a(4) = 4574792, a(5) = 210440432, a(6) = 9680259872

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
