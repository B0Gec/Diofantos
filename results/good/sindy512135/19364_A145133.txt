A145133: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 35, a(5) = 71, a(6) = 132, a(7) = 231

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
