A023953: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 5) + 178*a(n - 4) + 429*a(n - 3) - 188*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -223*a(n - 2) + 702*a(n - 3) + -504*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 453, a(3) = 6682

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
