A266283: 
a(n) = -999995*a(n - 4) + 10100*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 10101*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1010100*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1000000*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 101, a(3) = 1101010, a(4) = 10101, a(5) = 11110101010

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
