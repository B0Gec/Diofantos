A208674: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -14*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 37, a(4) = 163

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
