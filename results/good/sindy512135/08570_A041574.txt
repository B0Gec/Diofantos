A041574: 
a(n) = 336*a(n - 8) + 978*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 978*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 17, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 227, a(3) = 489, a(4) = 16853, a(5) = 34195, a(6) = 222023, a(7) = 478241

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
