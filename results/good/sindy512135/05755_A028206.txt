A028206: 
a(n) = -1982*a(n - 5) - 3537*a(n - 4) + 2101*a(n - 3) - 408*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -423*a(n - 2) + 2286*a(n - 3) + -4536*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 34, a(2) = 733, a(3) = 12826

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
