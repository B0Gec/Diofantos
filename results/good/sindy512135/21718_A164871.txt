A164871: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 3) - 34*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -75*a(n - 2) + 201*a(n - 3) + -288*a(n - 4) + 216*a(n - 5) + -72*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 118

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
