A165329: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + 16*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 6) + 16*a(n - 7) + 16*a(n - 8) + -136*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 306, a(3) = 5202, a(4) = 88434, a(5) = 1503378, a(6) = 25557426, a(7) = 434476242, a(8) = 7386096114
