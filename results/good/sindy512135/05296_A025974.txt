A025974: 
a(n) = -389*a(n - 5) - 234*a(n - 4) + 484*a(n - 3) - 178*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -193*a(n - 2) + 606*a(n - 3) + -616*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 383, a(3) = 5166

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
