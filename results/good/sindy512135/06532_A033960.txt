 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A033960: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 56

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
