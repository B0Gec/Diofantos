A147546: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 6) + 13*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -36*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 186

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
