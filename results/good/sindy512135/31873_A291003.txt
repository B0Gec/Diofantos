A291003: 
a(n) = -58*a(n - 6) - 51*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) + 87*a(n - 3) - 57*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -71*a(n - 2) + 154*a(n - 3) + -120*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 75, a(2) = 490, a(3) = 2956

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
