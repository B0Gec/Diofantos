A042484: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 222*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 222*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 27, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 83, a(3) = 111, a(4) = 6077, a(5) = 6188, a(6) = 18453, a(7) = 24641

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
