A181326: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 14*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -16*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 168, a(5) = 696

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
