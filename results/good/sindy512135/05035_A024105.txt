A024105: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -55*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3) + -95*a(n - 4) + 46*a(n - 5) + -9*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 648, a(4) = 6305, a(5) = 58424

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
