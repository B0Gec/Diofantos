A050685: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 10) + 31*a(n - 8) + 9*a(n - 6) - 93*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 19*a(n - 2) + -19*a(n - 3) + -90*a(n - 4) + 90*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 189

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
