A021514: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 36*a(n - 5) + 82*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 3) - 97*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -127*a(n - 2) + 288*a(n - 3) + -180*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 273, a(3) = 3208

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
