A022454: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 5) + 135*a(n - 4) + 285*a(n - 3) - 145*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -177*a(n - 2) + 505*a(n - 3) + -350*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 352, a(3) = 4530

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
