A131757: 
a(n) = a(n - 20)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -7, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 3, a(6) = -7, a(7) = 3, a(8) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
