A165365: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + 21*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + 21*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 5) + 21*a(n - 6) + 21*a(n - 7) + 21*a(n - 8) + -231*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 506, a(3) = 11132, a(4) = 244904, a(5) = 5387888, a(6) = 118533536, a(7) = 2607737792, a(8) = 57370231424
