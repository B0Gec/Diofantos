A028194: 
a(n) = -2107*a(n - 5) - 3729*a(n - 4) + 2244*a(n - 3) - 431*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -446*a(n - 2) + 2440*a(n - 3) + -4800*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 779, a(3) = 14095

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
