A164369: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6) + -15*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 42, a(3) = 252, a(4) = 1512, a(5) = 9072, a(6) = 54432

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
