A164964: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + 24*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3) + 24*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 5) + 24*a(n - 6) + 24*a(n - 7) + -300*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 650, a(3) = 16250, a(4) = 406250, a(5) = 10156250, a(6) = 253906250, a(7) = 6347656250

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
