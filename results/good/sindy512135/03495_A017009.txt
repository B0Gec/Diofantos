A017009: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 32, a(1) = 59049, a(2) = 1048576, a(3) = 6436343, a(4) = 24300000, a(5) = 69343957

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
