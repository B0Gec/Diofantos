A025971: 
a(n) = -288*a(n - 5) - 155*a(n - 4) + 357*a(n - 3) - 141*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -154*a(n - 2) + 456*a(n - 3) + -448*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 287, a(3) = 3249

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
