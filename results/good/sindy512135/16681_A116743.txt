A116743: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 75, a(5) = 267

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
