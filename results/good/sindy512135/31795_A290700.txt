A290700: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 49, a(4) = 141, a(5) = 389, a(6) = 1009, a(7) = 2761, a(8) = 7441

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
