A021354: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 19*a(n - 5) + 36*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 45*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -67*a(n - 2) + 126*a(n - 3) + -72*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 129, a(3) = 994

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
