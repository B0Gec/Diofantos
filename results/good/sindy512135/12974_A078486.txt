A078486: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 8) - 10*a(n - 7) - 10*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 53*a(n - 3) + -44*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5) + -6*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
