A164815: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 5) + 11*a(n - 6) + 11*a(n - 7) + -66*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 156, a(3) = 1872, a(4) = 22464, a(5) = 269568, a(6) = 3234816, a(7) = 38817792

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
