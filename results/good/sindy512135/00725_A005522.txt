A005522: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
