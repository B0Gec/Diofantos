A034662: 
a(n) = 5412*a(n - 5) - 6996*a(n - 4) + 2972*a(n - 3) - 534*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -609*a(n - 2) + 3948*a(n - 3) + -12180*a(n - 4) + 16800*a(n - 5) + -8000*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 42, a(2) = 546, a(3) = 9198, a(4) = 170898, a(5) = 3304182

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
