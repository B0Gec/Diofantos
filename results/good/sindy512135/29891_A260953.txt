A260953: 
a(n) = 16777216*a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 4097*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -4096*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 409, a(4) = 5041, a(5) = 6553, a(6) = 104857, a(7) = 1677721

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
