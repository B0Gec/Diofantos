A028111: 
a(n) = -601*a(n - 5) - 642*a(n - 4) + 670*a(n - 3) - 196*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -209*a(n - 2) + 786*a(n - 3) + -1080*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 367, a(3) = 4578

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
