A046915: 
a(n) = -51*a(n - 6) - 13*a(n - 5) + 45*a(n - 4) + 82*a(n - 3) - 78*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -97*a(n - 2) + 180*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 217, a(3) = 2340

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
