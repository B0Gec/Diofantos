A021092: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 25*a(n - 5) + 38*a(n - 4) + 31*a(n - 3) - 55*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 148*a(n - 3) + -80*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 205, a(3) = 2205

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
