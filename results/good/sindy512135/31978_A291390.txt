A291390: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) - 30*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + -50*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 130, a(3) = 940

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
