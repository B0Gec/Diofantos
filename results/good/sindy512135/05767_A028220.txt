A028220: 
a(n) = -165*a(n - 7) - 686*a(n - 6) - 2258*a(n - 5) - 4382*a(n - 4) + 2396*a(n - 3) - 439*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -455*a(n - 2) + 2605*a(n - 3) + -5544*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 770, a(3) = 13630

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
