A026241: 
a(n) = -718*a(n - 5) - 567*a(n - 4) + 890*a(n - 3) - 267*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -284*a(n - 2) + 1060*a(n - 3) + -1200*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 557, a(3) = 8977

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
