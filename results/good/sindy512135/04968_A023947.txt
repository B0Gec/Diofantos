A023947: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 5) + 207*a(n - 4) + 515*a(n - 3) - 220*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -257*a(n - 2) + 830*a(n - 3) + -600*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 527, a(3) = 8390

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
