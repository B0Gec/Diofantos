A041140: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 160*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 160*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 71, a(3) = 80, a(4) = 1351, a(5) = 1431, a(6) = 11368, a(7) = 12799

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
