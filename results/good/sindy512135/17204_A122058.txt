A122058: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 84

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
