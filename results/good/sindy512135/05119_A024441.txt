A024441: 
a(n) = 49*a(n - 5) + 205*a(n - 4) + 553*a(n - 3) - 214*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -249*a(n - 2) + 853*a(n - 3) + -630*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 480, a(3) = 7090

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
