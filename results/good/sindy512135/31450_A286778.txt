A286778: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 8) - 3*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 142

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
