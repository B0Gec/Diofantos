A041608: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 646*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 646*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 17, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 305, a(3) = 323, a(4) = 11287, a(5) = 11610, a(6) = 197047, a(7) = 208657

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
