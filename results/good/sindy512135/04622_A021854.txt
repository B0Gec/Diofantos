A021854: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 5) + 96*a(n - 4) + 168*a(n - 3) - 106*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -135*a(n - 2) + 340*a(n - 3) + -224*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 265, a(3) = 2940

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
