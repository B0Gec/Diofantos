A021134: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 6) + 27*a(n - 5) + 42*a(n - 4) + 39*a(n - 3) - 61*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -89*a(n - 2) + 163*a(n - 3) + -90*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 200, a(3) = 2050

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
