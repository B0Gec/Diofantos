A041962: 
a(n) = 898*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 898*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 22, a(1) = 45, a(2) = 202, a(3) = 449, a(4) = 19958, a(5) = 40365, a(6) = 181418, a(7) = 403201

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
