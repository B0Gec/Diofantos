A128800: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) + 31*a(n - 5) + 91*a(n - 4) + 165*a(n - 3) - 99*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -108*a(n - 2) + 216*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
