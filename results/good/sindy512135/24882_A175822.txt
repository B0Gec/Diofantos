A175822: 
a(n) = a(n - 14) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -3*a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 11, a(6) = 17, a(7) = 24, a(8) = 34, a(9) = 46

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
