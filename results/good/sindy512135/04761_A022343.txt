A022343: 
a(n) = 39*a(n - 5) + 120*a(n - 4) + 238*a(n - 3) - 130*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -161*a(n - 2) + 440*a(n - 3) + -300*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 323, a(3) = 4004

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
