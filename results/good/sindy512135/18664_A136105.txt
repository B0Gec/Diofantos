A136105: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 73, a(3) = 155, a(4) = 285

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
