A026108: 
a(n) = -651*a(n - 5) - 499*a(n - 4) + 807*a(n - 3) - 248*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -265*a(n - 2) + 966*a(n - 3) + -1080*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 519, a(3) = 8078

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
