A024079: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3) + -75*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 5) + -7*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 262, a(4) = 2145, a(5) = 16182

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
