A000102: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 2, a(6) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
