A028048: 
a(n) = -683*a(n - 5) - 651*a(n - 4) + 789*a(n - 3) - 235*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -251*a(n - 2) + 933*a(n - 3) + -1188*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 478, a(3) = 7062

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
