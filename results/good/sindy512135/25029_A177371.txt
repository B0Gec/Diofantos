A177371: 
a(n) = -22*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 14*a(n - 2) + -28*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 98, a(3) = 812, a(4) = 5748

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
