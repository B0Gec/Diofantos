A024347: 
a(n) = 53*a(n - 5) + 214*a(n - 4) + 566*a(n - 3) - 224*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -261*a(n - 2) + 882*a(n - 3) + -648*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 523, a(3) = 8218

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
