A103326: 
a(n) = -18*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 55, a(2) = 305, a(3) = 2255, a(4) = 15005

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
