A165445: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + 25*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + 25*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 5) + 25*a(n - 6) + 25*a(n - 7) + 25*a(n - 8) + -325*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 702, a(3) = 18252, a(4) = 474552, a(5) = 12338352, a(6) = 320797152, a(7) = 8340725952, a(8) = 216858874752
