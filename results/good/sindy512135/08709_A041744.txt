A041744: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 198*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 198*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 19, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 79, a(3) = 99, a(4) = 3841, a(5) = 3940, a(6) = 15661, a(7) = 19601

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
