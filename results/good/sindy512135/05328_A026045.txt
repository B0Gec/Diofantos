A026045: 
a(n) = a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 39, a(5) = 53, a(6) = 70, a(7) = 91

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
