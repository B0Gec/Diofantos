A108923: 
a(n) = -a(n - 17) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 9) + -3*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 21, a(6) = 28, a(7) = 36, a(8) = 44, a(9) = 52, a(10) = 60

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
