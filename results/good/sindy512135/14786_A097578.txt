A097578: 
a(n) = -a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2017, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
