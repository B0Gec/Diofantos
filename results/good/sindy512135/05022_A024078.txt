A024078: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -34*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 3) + -29*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 41, a(3) = 316, a(4) = 2337

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
