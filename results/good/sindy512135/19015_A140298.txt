A140298: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
