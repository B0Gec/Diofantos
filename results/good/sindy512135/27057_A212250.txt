A212250: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 54, a(5) = 129, a(6) = 262

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
