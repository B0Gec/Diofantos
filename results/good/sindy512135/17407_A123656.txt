A123656: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 5) + -7*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 81, a(2) = 811, a(3) = 4353, a(4) = 16251, a(5) = 47953, a(6) = 120051

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
