A006172: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -7*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 42

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
