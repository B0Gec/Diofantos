A173243: 
a(n) = 0
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 85, a(4) = 135, a(5) = 163, a(6) = 178, a(7) = 208, a(8) = 265, a(9) = 341

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
