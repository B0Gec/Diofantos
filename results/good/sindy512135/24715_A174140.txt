a(n) = a(n - 15)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 0*a(n - 11) + 0*a(n - 12) + 0*a(n - 13) + 0*a(n - 14) + 1*a(n - 15) + -1*a(n - 16),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 16, a(7) = 17, a(8) = 18, a(9) = 19, a(10) = 20, a(11) = 21, a(12) = 22, a(13) = 23, a(14) = 24, a(15) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
