A041407: 
a(n) = 502*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 502*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 17, a(5) = 489, a(6) = 506, a(7) = 2007, a(8) = 6527, a(9) = 8534

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
