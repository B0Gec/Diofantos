A248089: 
a(n) = -15*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + -27*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
