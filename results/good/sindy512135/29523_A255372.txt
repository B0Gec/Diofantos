A255372: 
a(n) = -34*a(n - 5) + 35*a(n - 4) - 78*a(n - 3) - 84*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -100*a(n - 2) + -9*a(n - 3) + 99*a(n - 4) + -90*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 261

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
