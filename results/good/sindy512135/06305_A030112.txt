A030112: 
a(n) = -11*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 204, a(4) = 1086, a(5) = 5916, a(6) = 31998, a(7) = 173502

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
