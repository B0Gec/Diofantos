 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A019722: 
a(n) = 53*a(n - 5) + 166*a(n - 4) + 351*a(n - 3) - 181*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -192*a(n - 2) + 432*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 433

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
