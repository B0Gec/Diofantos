A059021: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + -22*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 6) + -9*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 218, a(4) = 1126, a(5) = 5726, a(6) = 28992, a(7) = 146642

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
