A015298: 
a(n) = 9990021*a(n - 2) + 9001*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9091*a(n - 1) + 9181910*a(n - 2) + -918191000*a(n - 3) + -9091000000*a(n - 4) + 10000000000*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9091, a(2) = 91828191, a(3) = 917364637191, a(4) = 9174563736547191

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
