A174529: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) + 5*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -5*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
