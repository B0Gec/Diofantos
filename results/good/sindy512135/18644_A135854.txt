A135854: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
