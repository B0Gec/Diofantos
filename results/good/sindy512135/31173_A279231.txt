A279231: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
