A021084: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 6) + 23*a(n - 5) + 34*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) - 50*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -77*a(n - 2) + 134*a(n - 3) + -72*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 179, a(3) = 1766

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
