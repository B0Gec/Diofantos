A121199: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 26*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 44*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -60*a(n - 2) + 82*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 98, a(3) = 504

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
