A025933: 
a(n) = -118*a(n - 6) - 125*a(n - 5) - 25*a(n - 4) + 201*a(n - 3) - 103*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -121*a(n - 2) + 309*a(n - 3) + -270*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 240, a(3) = 2570

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
