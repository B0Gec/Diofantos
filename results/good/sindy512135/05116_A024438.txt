A024438: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 5) + 188*a(n - 4) + 487*a(n - 3) - 197*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -231*a(n - 2) + 766*a(n - 3) + -560*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 445, a(3) = 6330

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
