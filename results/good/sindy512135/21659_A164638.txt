A164638: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + 23*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 3) + 23*a(n - 4) + 23*a(n - 5) + 23*a(n - 6) + -276*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 600, a(3) = 14400, a(4) = 345600, a(5) = 8294400, a(6) = 199065600

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
