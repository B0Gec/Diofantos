A015276: 
a(n) = 449*a(n - 3) + 32769*a(n - 2) - 448*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -455*a(n - 1) + 29640*a(n - 2) + 232960*a(n - 3) + -262144*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -455, a(2) = 236665, a(3) = -120935815

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
