A164579: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 56, a(2) = 81, a(3) = 198, a(4) = 480, a(5) = 578, a(6) = 950, a(7) = 1656, a(8) = 1875, a(9) = 2646
