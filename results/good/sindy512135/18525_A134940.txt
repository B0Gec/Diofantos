A134940: 
a(n) = -1100*a(n - 5) - 1242*a(n - 4) + 1254*a(n - 3) - 325*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -342*a(n - 2) + 1440*a(n - 3) + -2025*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 424, a(3) = 7889

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
