A164777: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 7) + -28*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 576, a(4) = 4608, a(5) = 36864, a(6) = 294912, a(7) = 2359296

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
