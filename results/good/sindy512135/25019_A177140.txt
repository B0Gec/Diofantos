A177140: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 14*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 183

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
