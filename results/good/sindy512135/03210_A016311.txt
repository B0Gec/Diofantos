 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A016311: 
a(n) = 33*a(n - 5) + 54*a(n - 4) + 56*a(n - 3) - 74*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -86*a(n - 2) + 112*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 203

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
