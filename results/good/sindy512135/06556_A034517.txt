A034517: 
a(n) = -53*a(n - 6) - 14*a(n - 5) + 45*a(n - 4) + 84*a(n - 3) - 78*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -97*a(n - 2) + 180*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 130, a(3) = 1134

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
