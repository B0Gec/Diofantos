A028214: 
a(n) = -2406*a(n - 5) - 4617*a(n - 4) + 2537*a(n - 3) - 461*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -476*a(n - 2) + 2736*a(n - 3) + -5760*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 820, a(3) = 15120

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
