A238538: 
a(n) = 66*a(n - 5) + 119*a(n - 4) + 149*a(n - 3) - 159*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -202*a(n - 2) + 432*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 219, a(3) = 3315

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
