A021304: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 5) + 101*a(n - 4) + 125*a(n - 3) - 135*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -173*a(n - 2) + 366*a(n - 3) + -216*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 403, a(3) = 5886

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
