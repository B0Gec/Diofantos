A022565: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 5) + 150*a(n - 4) + 331*a(n - 3) - 160*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -193*a(n - 2) + 570*a(n - 3) + -400*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 383, a(3) = 5130

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
