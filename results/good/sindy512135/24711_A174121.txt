A174121: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 61

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
