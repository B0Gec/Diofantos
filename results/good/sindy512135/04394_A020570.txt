 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A020570: 
a(n) = 38*a(n - 5) + 128*a(n - 4) + 275*a(n - 3) - 137*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -146*a(n - 2) + 336*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 295

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
