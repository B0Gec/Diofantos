A334909: 
a(n) = -630*a(n - 5) - 434*a(n - 4) + 788*a(n - 3) - 262*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -280*a(n - 2) + 960*a(n - 3) + -1024*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 770, a(3) = 14260

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
