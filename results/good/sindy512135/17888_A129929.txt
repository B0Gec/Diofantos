A129929: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
