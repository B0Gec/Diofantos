A036258: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 6) + 53*a(n - 5) + 218*a(n - 4) - 84*a(n - 3) - 41*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + -75*a(n - 3) + 250*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 90, a(3) = 945

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
