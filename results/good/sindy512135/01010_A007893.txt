A007893: 
a(n) = a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 4, a(6) = 9, a(7) = 16, a(8) = 25, a(9) = 4, a(10) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
