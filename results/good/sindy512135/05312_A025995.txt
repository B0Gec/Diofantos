A025995: 
a(n) = -475*a(n - 5) - 327*a(n - 4) + 588*a(n - 3) - 198*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -213*a(n - 2) + 719*a(n - 3) + -770*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 412, a(3) = 5694

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
