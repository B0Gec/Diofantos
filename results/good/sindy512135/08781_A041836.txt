A041836: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 8) + 880*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 880*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 20, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 419, a(3) = 440, a(4) = 18019, a(5) = 18459, a(6) = 368740, a(7) = 387199

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
