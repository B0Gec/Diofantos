A074087: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -12*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
