A275101: 
a(n) = 6913*a(n - 5) - 10657*a(n - 4) + 4416*a(n - 3) - 718*a(n - 2) + 47*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 1) + -718*a(n - 2) + 4416*a(n - 3) + -10656*a(n - 4) + 6912*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 131, a(3) = 1613, a(4) = 25097

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
