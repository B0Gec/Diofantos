A167617: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -6, a(4) = 10, a(5) = -21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
