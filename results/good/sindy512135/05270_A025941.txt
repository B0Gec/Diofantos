A025941: 
a(n) = -166*a(n - 6) - 189*a(n - 5) - 59*a(n - 4) + 295*a(n - 3) - 137*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -157*a(n - 2) + 432*a(n - 3) + -396*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 327, a(3) = 4172

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
