A022448: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 5) + 141*a(n - 4) + 291*a(n - 3) - 152*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -185*a(n - 2) + 522*a(n - 3) + -360*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 391, a(3) = 5466

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
