A022455: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 5) + 146*a(n - 4) + 316*a(n - 3) - 157*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -190*a(n - 2) + 552*a(n - 3) + -385*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 386, a(3) = 5256

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
