A042019: 
a(n) = 12236*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 12236*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 23, a(4) = 265, a(5) = 12213, a(6) = 134608, a(7) = 146821, a(8) = 281429, a(9) = 3242540
