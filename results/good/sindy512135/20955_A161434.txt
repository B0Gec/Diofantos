A161434: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -30*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 57, a(3) = 524, a(4) = 4803, a(5) = 44022

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
