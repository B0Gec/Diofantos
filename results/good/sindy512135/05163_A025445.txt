A025445: 
a(n) = -78*a(n - 6) - 74*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 124*a(n - 3) - 73*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -89*a(n - 2) + 206*a(n - 3) + -168*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 167, a(3) = 1454

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
