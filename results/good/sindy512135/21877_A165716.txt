A165716: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 55

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
