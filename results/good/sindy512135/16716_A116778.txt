A116778: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 240

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
