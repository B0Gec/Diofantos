A235163: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 75, a(3) = 217, a(4) = 629

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
