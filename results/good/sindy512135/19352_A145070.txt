A145070: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
