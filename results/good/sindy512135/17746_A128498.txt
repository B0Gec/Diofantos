A128498: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -3, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 7, a(6) = -13, a(7) = -13, a(8) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
