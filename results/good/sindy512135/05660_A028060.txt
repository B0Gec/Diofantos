A028060: 
a(n) = -546*a(n - 5) - 515*a(n - 4) + 625*a(n - 3) - 192*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -206*a(n - 2) + 744*a(n - 3) + -945*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 370, a(3) = 4680

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
