a(n) = 49*a(n - 10) + 45*a(n - 8) + 16*a(n - 6) - 132*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 25*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -152*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 128*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 111, a(4) = 64, a(5) = 1919

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
