A028199: 
a(n) = -2747*a(n - 5) - 5297*a(n - 4) + 2911*a(n - 3) - 511*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 38*a(n - 1) + -527*a(n - 2) + 3130*a(n - 3) + -6600*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 38, a(2) = 917, a(3) = 17950

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
