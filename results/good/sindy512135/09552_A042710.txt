A042710: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 238*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 238*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 29, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 89, a(3) = 119, a(4) = 6991, a(5) = 7110, a(6) = 21211, a(7) = 28321

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
