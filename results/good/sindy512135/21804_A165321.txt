A165321: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 6) + 15*a(n - 7) + 15*a(n - 8) + -120*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 272, a(3) = 4352, a(4) = 69632, a(5) = 1114112, a(6) = 17825792, a(7) = 285212672, a(8) = 4563402752
