A242497: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) + 4*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 51, a(7) = 52

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
