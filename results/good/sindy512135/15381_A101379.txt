A101379: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 5) + -7*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 256, a(4) = 1325, a(5) = 4815, a(6) = 13916

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
