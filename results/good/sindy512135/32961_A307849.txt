A307849: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 128, a(3) = 362, a(4) = 813, a(5) = 1588

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
