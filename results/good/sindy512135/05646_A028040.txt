A028040: 
a(n) = -497*a(n - 5) - 429*a(n - 4) + 575*a(n - 3) - 187*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -201*a(n - 2) + 694*a(n - 3) + -840*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 375, a(3) = 4870

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
