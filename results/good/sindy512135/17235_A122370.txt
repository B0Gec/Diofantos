A122370: 
a(n) = -58*a(n - 6) - 46*a(n - 5) + 13*a(n - 4) + 87*a(n - 3) - 60*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -81*a(n - 2) + 192*a(n - 3) + -189*a(n - 4) + 53*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 172, a(4) = 1026

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
