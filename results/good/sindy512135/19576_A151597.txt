A151597: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 6) - 43*a(n - 5) + 60*a(n - 3) - 48*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -58*a(n - 2) + 106*a(n - 3) + -85*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 606, a(3) = 4744, a(4) = 30850

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
