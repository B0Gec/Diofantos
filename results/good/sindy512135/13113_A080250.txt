A080250: 
a(n) = 84*a(n - 5) + 284*a(n - 4) + 677*a(n - 3) - 307*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -354*a(n - 2) + 1120*a(n - 3) + -800*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 871, a(3) = 19215

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
