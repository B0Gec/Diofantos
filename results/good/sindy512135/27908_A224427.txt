A224427: 
a(n) = -18*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + 19*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 30*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -42*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + -32*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 343, a(1) = 8967, a(2) = 88679, a(3) = 620839

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
