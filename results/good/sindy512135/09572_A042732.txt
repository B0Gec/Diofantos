A042732: 
a(n) = 148*a(n - 8) + 898*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 898*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 29, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 419, a(3) = 449, a(4) = 26461, a(5) = 26910, a(6) = 376291, a(7) = 403201

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
