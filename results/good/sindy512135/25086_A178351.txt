A178351: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 5) + 220*a(n - 4) + 769*a(n - 3) - 269*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + -590*a(n - 2) + 3800*a(n - 3) + -9009*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 364, a(3) = 4833

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
