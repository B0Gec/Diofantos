A028224: 
a(n) = -2920*a(n - 5) - 6101*a(n - 4) + 3057*a(n - 3) - 518*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 38*a(n - 1) + -533*a(n - 2) + 3268*a(n - 3) + -7392*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 38, a(2) = 911, a(3) = 17632

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
