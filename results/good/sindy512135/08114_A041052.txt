A041052: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 34*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 34*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 181, a(5) = 198, a(6) = 379, a(7) = 577

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
