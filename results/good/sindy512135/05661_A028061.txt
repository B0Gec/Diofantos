A028061: 
a(n) = -602*a(n - 5) - 583*a(n - 4) + 688*a(n - 3) - 207*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -221*a(n - 2) + 815*a(n - 3) + -1050*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 404, a(3) = 5390

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
