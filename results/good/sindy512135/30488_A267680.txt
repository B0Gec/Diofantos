A267680: 
a(n) = -95*a(n - 4) - 10003*a(n - 3) + 101*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 101*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -10100*a(n - 3) + 10000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 10101, a(3) = 1100011

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
