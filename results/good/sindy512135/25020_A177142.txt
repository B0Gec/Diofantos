A177142: 
a(n) = -13*a(n - 5) - 22*a(n - 4) - 65*a(n - 3) + 30*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 30*a(n - 2) + -69*a(n - 3) + -31*a(n - 4) + 22*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 82, a(3) = 663, a(4) = 4985

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
