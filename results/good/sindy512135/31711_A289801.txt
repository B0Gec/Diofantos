A289801: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 62*a(n - 3) + -74*a(n - 4) + 57*a(n - 5) + -28*a(n - 6) + 8*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 133, a(4) = 597, a(5) = 2661, a(6) = 11856, a(7) = 52878

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
