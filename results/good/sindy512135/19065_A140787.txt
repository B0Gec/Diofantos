A140787: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
