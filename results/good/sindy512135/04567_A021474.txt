A021474: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 35*a(n - 5) + 77*a(n - 4) + 106*a(n - 3) - 91*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -122*a(n - 2) + 268*a(n - 3) + -165*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 278, a(3) = 3388

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
