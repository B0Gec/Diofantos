A164503: 
a(n) = -a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 55, a(4) = 87, a(5) = 136, a(6) = 211

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
