A021202: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 6) + 34*a(n - 5) + 56*a(n - 4) + 58*a(n - 3) - 79*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -110*a(n - 2) + 212*a(n - 3) + -120*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 251, a(3) = 2891

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
