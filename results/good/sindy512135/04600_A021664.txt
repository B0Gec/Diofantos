A021664: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 5) + 116*a(n - 4) + 190*a(n - 3) - 133*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -167*a(n - 2) + 409*a(n - 3) + -264*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 362, a(3) = 4894

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
