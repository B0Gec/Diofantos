A164686: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + 40*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + 40*a(n - 4) + 40*a(n - 5) + 40*a(n - 6) + -820*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 42, a(2) = 1722, a(3) = 70602, a(4) = 2894682, a(5) = 118681962, a(6) = 4865960442

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
