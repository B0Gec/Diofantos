A028128: 
a(n) = -1223*a(n - 5) - 1625*a(n - 4) + 1348*a(n - 3) - 322*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -338*a(n - 2) + 1520*a(n - 3) + -2400*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 623, a(3) = 10355

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
