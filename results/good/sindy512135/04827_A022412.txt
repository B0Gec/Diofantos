A022412: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 5) + 130*a(n - 4) + 264*a(n - 3) - 141*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -173*a(n - 2) + 481*a(n - 3) + -330*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 356, a(3) = 4690

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
