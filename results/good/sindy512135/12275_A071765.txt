A071765: 
a(n) = -73*a(n - 6) - 30*a(n - 5) + 51*a(n - 4) + 129*a(n - 3) - 94*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -115*a(n - 2) + 240*a(n - 3) + -144*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 96, a(2) = 1560, a(3) = 20160

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
