A021174: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 25*a(n - 5) + 40*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 57*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -83*a(n - 2) + 152*a(n - 3) + -84*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 173, a(3) = 1592

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
