A042856: 
a(n) = -17*a(n - 8) + 1920*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1920*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 30, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 929, a(3) = 960, a(4) = 58529, a(5) = 59489, a(6) = 1783710, a(7) = 1843199

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
