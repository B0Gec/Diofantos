A123259: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 4) - 18*a(n - 3) - 64*a(n - 2) - 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -13*a(n - 1) + -74*a(n - 2) + -74*a(n - 3) + -13*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = -7, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 233, a(4) = -3357

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
