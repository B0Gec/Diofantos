A070413: 
a(n) = a(n - 14)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 23, a(5) = 16, a(6) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
