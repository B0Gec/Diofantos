A001593: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + 95*a(n - 3) + -115*a(n - 4) + 81*a(n - 5) + -31*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 57, a(3) = 368, a(4) = 1649, a(5) = 6250, a(6) = 23401

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
