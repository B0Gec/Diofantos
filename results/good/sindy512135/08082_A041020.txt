A041020: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 20) + a(n - 8) + 30*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 30*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 101, a(5) = 116, a(6) = 333, a(7) = 449

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
