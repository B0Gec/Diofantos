A277669: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 160, a(4) = 826, a(5) = 4264

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
