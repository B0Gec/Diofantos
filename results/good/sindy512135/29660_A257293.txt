A257293: 
a(n) = -102*a(n - 8) + 103*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 102*a(n - 4) + -102*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 75, a(3) = 432, a(4) = 998, a(5) = 3624, a(6) = 8310, a(7) = 44717, a(8) = 102443

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
