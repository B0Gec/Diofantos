A025958: 
a(n) = -103*a(n - 6) - 115*a(n - 5) - 29*a(n - 4) + 176*a(n - 3) - 88*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -104*a(n - 2) + 268*a(n - 3) + -240*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 185, a(3) = 1645

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
