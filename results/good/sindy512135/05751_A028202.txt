A028202: 
a(n) = -1666*a(n - 5) - 2821*a(n - 4) + 1772*a(n - 3) - 363*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -377*a(n - 2) + 1942*a(n - 3) + -3696*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 647, a(3) = 10582

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
