A122501: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 6) - 11*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 3) + 21*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 22*a(n - 2) + 54*a(n - 3) + 38*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 47, a(3) = 211

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
