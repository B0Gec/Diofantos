A126640: 
a(n) = 93*a(n - 6) - 93*a(n - 5) - 99*a(n - 4) + 159*a(n - 3) - 73*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -85*a(n - 2) + 225*a(n - 3) + -274*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 60, a(2) = 422, a(3) = 2784, a(4) = 17318

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
