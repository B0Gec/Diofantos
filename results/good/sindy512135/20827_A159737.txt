A159737: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) - 171*a(n - 3) - 7002*a(n - 2) + 167*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 189*a(n - 1) + -10731*a(n - 2) + 173215*a(n - 3) + -1094856*a(n - 4) + 2420208*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 150, a(1) = 22680, a(2) = 2596608, a(3) = 273322980, a(4) = 27558217008

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
