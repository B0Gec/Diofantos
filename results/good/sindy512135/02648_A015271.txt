A015271: 
a(n) = -790*a(n - 4) + 3936*a(n - 3) + 842*a(n - 2) - 52*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -51*a(n - 1) + 884*a(n - 2) + 3264*a(n - 3) + -4096*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -51, a(2) = 3485, a(3) = -219555

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
