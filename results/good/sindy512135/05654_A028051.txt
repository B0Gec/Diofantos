A028051: 
a(n) = -817*a(n - 5) - 814*a(n - 4) + 942*a(n - 3) - 270*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -286*a(n - 2) + 1104*a(n - 3) + -1440*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 555, a(3) = 8905

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
