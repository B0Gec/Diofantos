A021734: 
a(n) = 63*a(n - 5) + 165*a(n - 4) + 300*a(n - 3) - 188*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -227*a(n - 2) + 597*a(n - 3) + -396*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 502, a(3) = 8022

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
