A261728: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 0*a(n - 11) + -1*a(n - 12),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 9, a(6) = 7, a(7) = 12, a(8) = 10, a(9) = 15, a(10) = 5, a(11) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
