A192834: 
a(n) = 110*a(n - 6) - 107*a(n - 5) - 122*a(n - 4) + 186*a(n - 3) - 82*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -95*a(n - 2) + 260*a(n - 3) + -324*a(n - 4) + 144*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 80, a(3) = 800, a(4) = 6248

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
