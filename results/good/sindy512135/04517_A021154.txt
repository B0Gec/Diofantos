A021154: 
a(n) = -76*a(n - 6) - 27*a(n - 5) + 49*a(n - 4) + 102*a(n - 3) - 87*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -105*a(n - 2) + 197*a(n - 3) + -110*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 256, a(3) = 3066

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
