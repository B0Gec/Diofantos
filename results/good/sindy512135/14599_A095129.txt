A095129: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - 17*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
