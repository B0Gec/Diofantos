A299276: 
a(n) = a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 31, a(4) = 59, a(5) = 101, a(6) = 161, a(7) = 242

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
