A144899: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + -20*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5) + -11*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 57, a(5) = 133, a(6) = 280, a(7) = 547

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
