A075907: 
a(n) = -2732*a(n - 5) - 4721*a(n - 4) + 2951*a(n - 3) - 542*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + -560*a(n - 2) + 3200*a(n - 3) + -6144*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 40, a(2) = 1040, a(3) = 22400

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
