A166327: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 11) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 48, a(6) = 96, a(7) = 192, a(8) = 384, a(9) = 768

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
