A021924: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 5) + 140*a(n - 4) + 280*a(n - 3) - 154*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -187*a(n - 2) + 516*a(n - 3) + -352*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 389, a(3) = 5364

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
