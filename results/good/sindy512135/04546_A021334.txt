A021334: 
a(n) = 67*a(n - 5) + 122*a(n - 4) + 158*a(n - 3) - 162*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -203*a(n - 2) + 442*a(n - 3) + -264*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 473, a(3) = 7462

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
