A042296: 
a(n) = 2477*a(n - 8) + 1348*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1350*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 25, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 649, a(3) = 675, a(4) = 34399, a(5) = 35074, a(6) = 876175, a(7) = 911249

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
