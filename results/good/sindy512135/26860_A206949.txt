A206949: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
