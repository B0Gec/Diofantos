A166728: 
a(n) = a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 46, a(4) = 56, a(5) = 66, a(6) = 76, a(7) = 86, a(8) = 96, a(9) = 106

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
