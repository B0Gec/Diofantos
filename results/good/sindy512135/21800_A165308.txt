A165308: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + 14*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 4) + 14*a(n - 5) + 14*a(n - 6) + 14*a(n - 7) + 14*a(n - 8) + -105*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 240, a(3) = 3600, a(4) = 54000, a(5) = 810000, a(6) = 12150000, a(7) = 182250000, a(8) = 2733750000
