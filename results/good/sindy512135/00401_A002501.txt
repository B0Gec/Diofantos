 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A002501: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 22*a(n - 5) + 41*a(n - 4) + 45*a(n - 3) - 51*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -61*a(n - 2) + 84*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 205

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
