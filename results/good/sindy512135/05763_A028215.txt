A028215: 
a(n) = -2607*a(n - 5) - 5122*a(n - 4) + 2745*a(n - 3) - 487*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37*a(n - 1) + -502*a(n - 2) + 2952*a(n - 3) + -6336*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 867, a(3) = 16457

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
