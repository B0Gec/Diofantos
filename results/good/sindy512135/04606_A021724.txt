A021724: 
a(n) = 59*a(n - 5) + 152*a(n - 4) + 270*a(n - 3) - 174*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -211*a(n - 2) + 546*a(n - 3) + -360*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 465, a(3) = 7150

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
