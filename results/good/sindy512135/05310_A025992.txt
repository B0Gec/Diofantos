A025992: 
a(n) = -352*a(n - 5) - 220*a(n - 4) + 435*a(n - 3) - 157*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -171*a(n - 2) + 542*a(n - 3) + -560*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 313, a(3) = 3666

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
