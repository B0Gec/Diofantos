A025927: 
a(n) = -108*a(n - 6) - 109*a(n - 5) - 12*a(n - 4) + 178*a(n - 3) - 98*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -116*a(n - 2) + 284*a(n - 3) + -240*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 245, a(3) = 2735

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
