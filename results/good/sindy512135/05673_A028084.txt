A028084: 
a(n) = -963*a(n - 5) - 1106*a(n - 4) + 1091*a(n - 3) - 281*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -297*a(n - 2) + 1251*a(n - 3) + -1782*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 544, a(3) = 8414

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
