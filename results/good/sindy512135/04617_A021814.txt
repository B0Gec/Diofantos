A021814: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 32*a(n - 5) + 84*a(n - 4) + 139*a(n - 3) - 94*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -122*a(n - 2) + 296*a(n - 3) + -192*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 239, a(3) = 2519

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
