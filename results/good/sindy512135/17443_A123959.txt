A123959: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
