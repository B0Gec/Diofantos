A238539: 
a(n) = -34*a(n - 5) - 244*a(n - 4) + 129*a(n - 3) + 139*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 138*a(n - 2) + 112*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 399, a(3) = 7735

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
