A174515: 
a(n) = -702*a(n - 5) - 808*a(n - 4) + 776*a(n - 3) - 214*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -228*a(n - 2) + 900*a(n - 3) + -1296*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 397, a(3) = 5125

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
