A028083: 
a(n) = -883*a(n - 5) - 992*a(n - 4) + 1000*a(n - 3) - 264*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -279*a(n - 2) + 1152*a(n - 3) + -1620*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 505, a(3) = 7480

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
