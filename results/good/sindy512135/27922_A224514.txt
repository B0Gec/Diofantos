A224514: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 20, a(4) = 70

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
