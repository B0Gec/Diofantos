A134815: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 162, a(4) = 790, a(5) = 3923, a(6) = 19602, a(7) = 98108

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
