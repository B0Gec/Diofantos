A028062: 
a(n) = -658*a(n - 5) - 651*a(n - 4) + 752*a(n - 3) - 221*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -236*a(n - 2) + 886*a(n - 3) + -1155*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 440, a(3) = 6190

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
