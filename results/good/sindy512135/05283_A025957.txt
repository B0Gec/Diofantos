A025957: 
a(n) = -502*a(n - 5) - 288*a(n - 4) + 639*a(n - 3) - 235*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -253*a(n - 2) + 798*a(n - 3) + -792*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 531, a(3) = 8582

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
