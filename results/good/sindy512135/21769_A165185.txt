A165185: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 8) + -6*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 80, a(4) = 320, a(5) = 1280, a(6) = 5120, a(7) = 20480, a(8) = 81920

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
