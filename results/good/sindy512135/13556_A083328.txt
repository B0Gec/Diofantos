A083328: 
a(n) = -131*a(n - 6) - 188*a(n - 5) - 107*a(n - 4) + 245*a(n - 3) - 104*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -119*a(n - 2) + 342*a(n - 3) + -360*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
