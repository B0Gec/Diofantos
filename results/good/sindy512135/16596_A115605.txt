A115605: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -3*a(n - 7) + -6*a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 31, a(5) = 128, a(6) = 549, a(7) = 2315, a(8) = 9826, a(9) = 41594

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
