A021614: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 5) + 103*a(n - 4) + 163*a(n - 3) - 120*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -152*a(n - 2) + 362*a(n - 3) + -231*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 332, a(3) = 4322

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
