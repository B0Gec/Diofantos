A024446: 
a(n) = 59*a(n - 5) + 273*a(n - 4) + 833*a(n - 3) - 284*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -323*a(n - 2) + 1217*a(n - 3) + -924*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 638, a(3) = 10982

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
