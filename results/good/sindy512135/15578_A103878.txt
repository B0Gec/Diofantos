A103878: 
a(n) = -660725*a(n - 4) + 101289*a(n - 3) - 5581*a(n - 2) + 128*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 137*a(n - 1) + -6750*a(n - 2) + 153000*a(n - 3) + -1620000*a(n - 4) + 6480000*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 137, a(3) = 12019, a(4) = 874853

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
