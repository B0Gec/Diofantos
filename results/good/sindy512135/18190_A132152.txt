A132152: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 16) - 6*a(n - 12) + 10*a(n - 8) + 11*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 16*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 10, a(6) = 20, a(7) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
