A081138: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) + 44*a(n - 5) + 174*a(n - 4) + 442*a(n - 3) - 183*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -192*a(n - 2) + 512*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
