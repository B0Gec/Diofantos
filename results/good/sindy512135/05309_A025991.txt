A025991: 
a(n) = -447*a(n - 5) - 295*a(n - 4) + 555*a(n - 3) - 192*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -208*a(n - 2) + 684*a(n - 3) + -720*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 417, a(3) = 5909

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
