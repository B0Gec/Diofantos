A101180: 
a(n) = 115598*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 115598*a(n - 4) + -115598*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 671, a(3) = 15639, a(4) = 42159, a(5) = 981911, a(6) = 77624048, a(7) = 1807894920, a(8) = 4873553880
