A116777: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 7) - 22*a(n - 5) + 26*a(n - 4) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 52*a(n - 3) + -45*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 74, a(5) = 253

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
