A074877: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 15, a(1) = 106, a(2) = 541, a(3) = 2432

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
