A011769: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 19, a(4) = 51, a(5) = 141

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
