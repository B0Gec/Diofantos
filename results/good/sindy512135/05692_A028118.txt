A028118: 
a(n) = -825*a(n - 5) - 976*a(n - 4) + 914*a(n - 3) - 245*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -259*a(n - 2) + 1053*a(n - 3) + -1540*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 470, a(3) = 6750

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
