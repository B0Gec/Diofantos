A231000: 
a(n) = a(n - 7)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 17, a(5) = 22, a(6) = 23, a(7) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
