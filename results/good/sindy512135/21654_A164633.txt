A164633: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + 18*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3) + 18*a(n - 4) + 18*a(n - 5) + 18*a(n - 6) + -171*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 380, a(3) = 7220, a(4) = 137180, a(5) = 2606420, a(6) = 49521980

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
