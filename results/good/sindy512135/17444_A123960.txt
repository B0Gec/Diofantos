A123960: 
a(n) = -11*a(n - 9) - 13*a(n - 8) - 14*a(n - 7) - 10*a(n - 6) + 19*a(n - 4) + 26*a(n - 3) - 30*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3) + -49*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
