A021424: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 25*a(n - 5) + 51*a(n - 4) + 62*a(n - 3) - 61*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -86*a(n - 2) + 176*a(n - 3) + -105*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 170, a(3) = 1520

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
