A342327: 
a(n) = 752*a(n - 4) + 3125*a(n - 3) - 780*a(n - 2) + 53*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 57*a(n - 1) + -1002*a(n - 2) + 6562*a(n - 3) + -15381*a(n - 4) + 9765*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 64705, a(1) = 2542687, a(2) = 87880249, a(3) = 2867519047, a(4) = 91094247025

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
