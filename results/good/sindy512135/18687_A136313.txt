A136313: 
a(n) = a(n - 11)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 11, a(5) = 19, a(6) = 5, a(7) = 13, a(8) = 21, a(9) = 7, a(10) = 15
