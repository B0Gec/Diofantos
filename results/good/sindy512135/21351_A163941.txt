A163941: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - 13*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 52, a(3) = 246

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
