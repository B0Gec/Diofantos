A021344: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 17*a(n - 5) + 30*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) - 38*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -59*a(n - 2) + 107*a(n - 3) + -60*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 110, a(3) = 770

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
