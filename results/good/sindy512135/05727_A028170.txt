A028170: 
a(n) = -1071*a(n - 5) - 1514*a(n - 4) + 1159*a(n - 3) - 275*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -289*a(n - 2) + 1302*a(n - 3) + -2160*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 495, a(3) = 7070

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
