A095977: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) - a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
