A042088: 
a(n) = 274*a(n - 8) + 285*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 286*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 23, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 119, a(3) = 143, a(4) = 6697, a(5) = 6840, a(6) = 34057, a(7) = 40897

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
