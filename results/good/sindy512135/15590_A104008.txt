A104008: 
a(n) = -15*a(n - 4) - 207*a(n - 3) - 2686*a(n - 2) + 208*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 208*a(n - 1) + -2718*a(n - 2) + 208*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 120, a(1) = 25080, a(2) = 4890480, a(3) = 949077360

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
