A342234: 
a(n) = -6330*a(n - 5) - 14976*a(n - 4) + 6618*a(n - 3) - 943*a(n - 2) + 54*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 54*a(n - 1) + -963*a(n - 2) + 6966*a(n - 3) + -17496*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 216, a(3) = 7965

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
