A145134: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -14*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 6) + -10*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 56, a(5) = 127, a(6) = 259, a(7) = 490, a(8) = 876

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
