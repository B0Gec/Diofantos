A024999: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 5) + 260*a(n - 4) + 794*a(n - 3) - 269*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -307*a(n - 2) + 1158*a(n - 3) + -880*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 593, a(3) = 9738

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
