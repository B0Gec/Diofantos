A035878: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 32, a(4) = 272, a(5) = 160, a(6) = 888, a(7) = 448

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
