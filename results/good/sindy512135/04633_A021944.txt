A021944: 
a(n) = 50*a(n - 5) + 151*a(n - 4) + 307*a(n - 3) - 165*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -200*a(n - 2) + 560*a(n - 3) + -384*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 425, a(3) = 6185

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
