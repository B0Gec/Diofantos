A004057: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 7) + 6*a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) + 10*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 39, a(3) = 191

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
