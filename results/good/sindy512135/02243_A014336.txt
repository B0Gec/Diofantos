A014336: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - 5*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 22*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
