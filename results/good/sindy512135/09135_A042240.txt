A042240: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 610*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 610*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 25, a(1) = 51, a(2) = 127, a(3) = 305, a(4) = 15377, a(5) = 31059, a(6) = 77495, a(7) = 186049

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
