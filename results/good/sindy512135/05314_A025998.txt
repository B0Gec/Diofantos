A025998: 
a(n) = -491*a(n - 5) - 346*a(n - 4) + 608*a(n - 3) - 201*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -216*a(n - 2) + 740*a(n - 3) + -800*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 409, a(3) = 5565

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
