A088265: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 16) - 3*a(n - 12) - 2*a(n - 8) + 10*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -10*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 19, a(4) = 101, a(5) = 103, a(6) = 107, a(7) = 109

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
