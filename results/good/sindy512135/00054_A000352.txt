A000352: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 118, a(3) = 418

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
