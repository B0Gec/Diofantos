a(n) = a(n - 11)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11) + -2*a(n - 12) + 1*a(n - 13),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 10, a(6) = 15, a(7) = 21, a(8) = 28, a(9) = 36, a(10) = 45, a(11) = 55, a(12) = 65
