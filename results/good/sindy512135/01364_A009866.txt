A009866: 
a(n) = a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + -2*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 36, a(5) = 56, a(6) = 81, a(7) = 109, a(8) = 142, a(9) = 179

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
