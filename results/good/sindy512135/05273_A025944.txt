A025944: 
a(n) = -248*a(n - 5) - 108*a(n - 4) + 313*a(n - 3) - 135*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -149*a(n - 2) + 411*a(n - 3) + -378*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 292, a(3) = 3414

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
