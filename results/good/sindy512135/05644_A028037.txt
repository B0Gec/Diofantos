A028037: 
a(n) = -514*a(n - 5) - 436*a(n - 4) + 595*a(n - 3) - 195*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -210*a(n - 2) + 720*a(n - 3) + -864*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 415, a(3) = 5845

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
