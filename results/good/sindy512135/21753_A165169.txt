A165169: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + 35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + 35*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 5) + 35*a(n - 6) + 35*a(n - 7) + -630*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 1332, a(3) = 47952, a(4) = 1726272, a(5) = 62145792, a(6) = 2237248512, a(7) = 80540946432

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
