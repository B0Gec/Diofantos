A215828: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 6) + 31*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 25*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 31, a(4) = 53, a(5) = 87, a(6) = 1011, a(7) = 1673, a(8) = 2771

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
