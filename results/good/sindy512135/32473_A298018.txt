A298018: 
a(n) = a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 49, a(5) = 67, a(6) = 100

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
