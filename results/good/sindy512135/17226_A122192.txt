A122192: 
a(n) = 686*a(n - 4) - 2105*a(n - 3) - 759*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -759*a(n - 2) + -2576*a(n - 3) + -759*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -1518, a(3) = -7728, a(4) = 1149126, a(5) = 9775920

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
