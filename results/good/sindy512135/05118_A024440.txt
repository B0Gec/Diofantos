A024440: 
a(n) = 52*a(n - 5) + 217*a(n - 4) + 592*a(n - 3) - 227*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -263*a(n - 2) + 908*a(n - 3) + -672*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 521, a(3) = 8132

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
