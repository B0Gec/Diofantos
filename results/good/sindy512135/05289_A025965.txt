A025965: 
a(n) = -137*a(n - 6) - 164*a(n - 5) - 61*a(n - 4) + 246*a(n - 3) - 111*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -128*a(n - 2) + 356*a(n - 3) + -336*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 233, a(3) = 2351

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
