A028078: 
a(n) = -834*a(n - 5) - 906*a(n - 4) + 947*a(n - 3) - 258*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -273*a(n - 2) + 1098*a(n - 3) + -1512*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 511, a(3) = 7762

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
