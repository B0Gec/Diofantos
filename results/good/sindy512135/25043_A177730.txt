A177730: 
a(n) = -35*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) + 32*a(n - 4) + 50*a(n - 3) - 54*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -70*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 245, a(3) = 2325

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
