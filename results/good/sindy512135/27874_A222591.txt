A222591: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 17, a(5) = 23, a(6) = 10, a(7) = 38, a(8) = 47

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
