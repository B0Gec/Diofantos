A228205: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 11*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 41, a(4) = 80, a(5) = 141, a(6) = 249, a(7) = 440

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
