 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A016304: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 25*a(n - 5) + 40*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 57*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -68*a(n - 2) + 84*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 157

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
