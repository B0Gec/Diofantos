A025993: 
a(n) = -393*a(n - 5) - 256*a(n - 4) + 486*a(n - 3) - 171*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -185*a(n - 2) + 601*a(n - 3) + -630*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 344, a(3) = 4258

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
