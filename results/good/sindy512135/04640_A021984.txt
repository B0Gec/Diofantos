A021984: 
a(n) = 54*a(n - 5) + 168*a(n - 4) + 358*a(n - 3) - 183*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -219*a(n - 2) + 634*a(n - 3) + -440*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 457, a(3) = 6822

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
