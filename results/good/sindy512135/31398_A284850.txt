A284850: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 7) + 6*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 171

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
