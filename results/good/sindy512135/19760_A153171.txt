A153171: 
a(n) = a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 6, a(2) = -6, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 12, a(5) = -24, a(6) = 54, a(7) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
