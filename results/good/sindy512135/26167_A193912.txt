A193912: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) - a(n - 16) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -6*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 50, a(5) = 93, a(6) = 162

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
