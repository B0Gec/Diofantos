A086443: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 6) + 12*a(n - 5) + 17*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
