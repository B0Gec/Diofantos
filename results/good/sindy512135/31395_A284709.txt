A284709: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 10, a(6) = 20, a(7) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
