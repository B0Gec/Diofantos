A024778: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 5) + 257*a(n - 4) + 778*a(n - 3) - 267*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -305*a(n - 2) + 1140*a(n - 3) + -864*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 595, a(3) = 9840

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
