A164781: 
a(n) = -25*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5) + 10*a(n - 6) + 10*a(n - 7) + -55*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 132, a(3) = 1452, a(4) = 15972, a(5) = 175692, a(6) = 1932612, a(7) = 21258732

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
