A022452: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 5) + 113*a(n - 4) + 222*a(n - 3) - 122*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -151*a(n - 2) + 411*a(n - 3) + -280*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 290, a(3) = 3330

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
