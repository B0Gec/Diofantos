A291238: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 79, a(4) = 202, a(5) = 508

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
