A065495: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
