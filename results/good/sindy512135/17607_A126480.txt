A126480: 
a(n) = -18*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -18*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 448, a(4) = 2816

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
