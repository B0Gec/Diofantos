A116165: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) + 38*a(n - 5) + 130*a(n - 4) + 283*a(n - 3) - 138*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -147*a(n - 2) + 343*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 294

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
