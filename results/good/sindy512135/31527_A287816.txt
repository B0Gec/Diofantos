A287816: 
a(n) = -17*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + 19*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 471, a(4) = 3413

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
