A024114: 
a(n) = 51*a(n - 5) + 196*a(n - 4) + 498*a(n - 3) - 206*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -242*a(n - 2) + 792*a(n - 3) + -576*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 487, a(3) = 7407

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
