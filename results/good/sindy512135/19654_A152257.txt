A152257: 
a(n) = -548*a(n - 5) - 48*a(n - 4) + 850*a(n - 3) - 367*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + -390*a(n - 2) + 1080*a(n - 3) + -729*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2019, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
