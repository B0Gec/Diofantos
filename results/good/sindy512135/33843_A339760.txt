A339760: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 208

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
