A133476: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
