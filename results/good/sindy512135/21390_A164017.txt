A164017: 
a(n) = -135*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + 25*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + 25*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 5) + -325*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 702, a(3) = 18252, a(4) = 474552, a(5) = 12338352

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
