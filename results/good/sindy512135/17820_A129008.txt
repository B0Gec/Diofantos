A129008: 
a(n) = -564*a(n - 6) - 1745*a(n - 5) - 3135*a(n - 4) + 1862*a(n - 3) - 368*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -384*a(n - 2) + 2048*a(n - 3) + -4096*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 16, a(1) = 768, a(2) = 18432, a(3) = 327680

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
