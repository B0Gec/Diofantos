A134045: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) + 14*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 22*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
