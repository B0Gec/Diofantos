A286985: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 39, a(3) = 115, a(4) = 343, a(5) = 967

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
