A298201: 
a(n) = -34*a(n - 6) - 7*a(n - 5) + 32*a(n - 4) + 50*a(n - 3) - 52*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -77*a(n - 2) + 161*a(n - 3) + -138*a(n - 4) + 40*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 32, a(1) = 114, a(2) = 548, a(3) = 2970, a(4) = 16892

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
