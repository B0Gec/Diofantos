A041319: 
a(n) = 1135*a(n - 10) + 2235*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 2236*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 85, a(5) = 2223, a(6) = 13423, a(7) = 15646, a(8) = 29069, a(9) = 190060
