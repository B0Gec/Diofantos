A021364: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 22*a(n - 5) + 41*a(n - 4) + 45*a(n - 3) - 51*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -75*a(n - 2) + 145*a(n - 3) + -84*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 150, a(3) = 1270

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
