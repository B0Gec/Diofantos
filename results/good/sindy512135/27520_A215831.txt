A215831: 
a(n) = -36*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -33*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 105*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 9, a(3) = -11, a(4) = 59, a(5) = -267, a(6) = 433, a(7) = -2041, a(8) = 9753

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
