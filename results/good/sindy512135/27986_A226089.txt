A226089: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 5) + -10*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 7) + -3*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 11, a(5) = 29, a(6) = 37, a(7) = 23, a(8) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
