A004452: 
a(n) = a(n - 16)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 0*a(n - 11) + 1*a(n - 12) + -1*a(n - 13),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 14, a(6) = 13, a(7) = 12, a(8) = 3, a(9) = 2, a(10) = 1, a(11) = 0, a(12) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
