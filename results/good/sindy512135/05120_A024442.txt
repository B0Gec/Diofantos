A024442: 
a(n) = 52*a(n - 5) + 220*a(n - 4) + 613*a(n - 3) - 230*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -266*a(n - 2) + 932*a(n - 3) + -693*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 518, a(3) = 7988

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
