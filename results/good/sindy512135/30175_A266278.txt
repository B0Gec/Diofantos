A266278: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 3) + -13*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 57, a(2) = 489, a(3) = 4125, a(4) = 35117, a(5) = 299681, a(6) = 2557605

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
