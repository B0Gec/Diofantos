A164681: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37*a(n - 1) + 37*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 3) + 37*a(n - 4) + 37*a(n - 5) + 37*a(n - 6) + -703*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 39, a(2) = 1482, a(3) = 56316, a(4) = 2140008, a(5) = 81320304, a(6) = 3090171552

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
