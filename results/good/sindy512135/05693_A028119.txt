A028119: 
a(n) = -894*a(n - 5) - 1076*a(n - 4) + 990*a(n - 3) - 260*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -275*a(n - 2) + 1136*a(n - 3) + -1680*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 509, a(3) = 7688

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
