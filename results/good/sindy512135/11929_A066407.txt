A066407: 
a(n) = -781*a(n - 5) - 558*a(n - 4) + 979*a(n - 3) - 315*a(n - 2) + 33*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -336*a(n - 2) + 1184*a(n - 3) + -1280*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2880, a(3) = 109440

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
