A128055: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 6) + 24*a(n - 5) - 12*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
