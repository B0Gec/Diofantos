A027012: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 47, a(3) = 199, a(4) = 661

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
