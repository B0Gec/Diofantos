A034663: 
a(n) = -299*a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 4) + 497*a(n - 3) - 241*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -262*a(n - 2) + 672*a(n - 3) + -441*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 500, a(3) = 9632

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
