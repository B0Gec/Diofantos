A024444: 
a(n) = 54*a(n - 5) + 238*a(n - 4) + 686*a(n - 3) - 248*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -285*a(n - 2) + 1027*a(n - 3) + -770*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 556, a(3) = 8886

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
