A116800: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 8) - 3*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -18*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -14*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
