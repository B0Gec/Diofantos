A095897: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 7) - 25*a(n - 6) + 20*a(n - 5) - 80*a(n - 4) - 37*a(n - 3) + 18*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 20*a(n - 2) + -32*a(n - 3) + -96*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 320

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
