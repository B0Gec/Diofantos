A081553: 
a(n) = -94*a(n - 5) + 48*a(n - 4) + 150*a(n - 3) - 131*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -163*a(n - 2) + 361*a(n - 3) + -320*a(n - 4) + 100*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 303, a(3) = 4006, a(4) = 50010

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
