A163110: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 6) - 12*a(n - 5) - 150*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) + 18*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + 17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -153*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 342, a(3) = 6156

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
