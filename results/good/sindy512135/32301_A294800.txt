A294800: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3) + -45*a(n - 4) + 26*a(n - 5) + -8*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 21, a(5) = 73, a(6) = 238

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
