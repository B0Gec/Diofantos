A124124: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
