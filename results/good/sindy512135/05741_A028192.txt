A028192: 
a(n) = -1927*a(n - 5) - 3319*a(n - 4) + 2056*a(n - 3) - 406*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -421*a(n - 2) + 2244*a(n - 3) + -4320*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 34, a(2) = 735, a(3) = 12920

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
