A164693: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 1) + 46*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 3) + 46*a(n - 4) + 46*a(n - 5) + 46*a(n - 6) + -1081*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 2256, a(3) = 106032, a(4) = 4983504, a(5) = 234224688, a(6) = 11008560336

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
