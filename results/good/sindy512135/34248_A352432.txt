A352432: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) + 18*a(n - 5) - 17*a(n - 4) - 16*a(n - 3) + 11*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + -18*a(n - 3) + -14*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 165

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
