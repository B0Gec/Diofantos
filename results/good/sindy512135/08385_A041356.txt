A041356: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 194*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 194*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 83, a(3) = 97, a(4) = 2605, a(5) = 2702, a(6) = 16115, a(7) = 18817

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
