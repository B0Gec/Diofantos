A317793: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 6) - 15*a(n - 4) - 17*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 13*a(n - 2) + -14*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 177

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
