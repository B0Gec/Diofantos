A192911: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
