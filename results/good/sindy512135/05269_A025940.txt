A025940: 
a(n) = -152*a(n - 6) - 171*a(n - 5) - 50*a(n - 4) + 268*a(n - 3) - 127*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -146*a(n - 2) + 396*a(n - 3) + -360*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 295, a(3) = 3525

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
