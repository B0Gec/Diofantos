A228937: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 13, a(4) = -2, a(5) = -17, a(6) = -90, a(7) = -28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
