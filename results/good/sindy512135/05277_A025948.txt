A025948: 
a(n) = -282*a(n - 5) - 131*a(n - 4) + 356*a(n - 3) - 149*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -163*a(n - 2) + 462*a(n - 3) + -432*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 321, a(3) = 3938

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
