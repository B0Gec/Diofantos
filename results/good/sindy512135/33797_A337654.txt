A337654: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 10, a(6) = 22, a(7) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
