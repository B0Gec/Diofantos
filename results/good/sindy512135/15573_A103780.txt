A103780: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 25, a(5) = 69, a(6) = 189, a(7) = 519, a(8) = 1428

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
