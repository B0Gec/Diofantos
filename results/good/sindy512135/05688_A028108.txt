A028108: 
a(n) = -1946*a(n - 5) - 2778*a(n - 4) + 2180*a(n - 3) - 443*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -461*a(n - 2) + 2406*a(n - 3) + -3960*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 835, a(3) = 15870

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
