A341579: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
