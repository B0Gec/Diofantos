A128832: 
a(n) = 1017*a(n - 5) - 1977*a(n - 4) + 1238*a(n - 3) - 310*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -310*a(n - 2) + 1240*a(n - 3) + -1984*a(n - 4) + 1024*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 81, a(2) = 2401, a(3) = 50625, a(4) = 923521

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
