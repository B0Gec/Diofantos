A224331: 
a(n) = -27*a(n - 5) + 30*a(n - 4) + 49*a(n - 3) - 64*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -78*a(n - 2) + 112*a(n - 3) + -49*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 291, a(3) = 2740

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
