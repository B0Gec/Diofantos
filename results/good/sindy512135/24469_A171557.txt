A171557: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) - 2*a(n - 8) - 5*a(n - 7) - 7*a(n - 6) - 24*a(n - 5) - 72*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = -9, a(3) = -81

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
