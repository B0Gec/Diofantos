A080151: 
a(n) = a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 2019, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 25, a(6) = 36, a(7) = 49, a(8) = 64, a(9) = 81

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
