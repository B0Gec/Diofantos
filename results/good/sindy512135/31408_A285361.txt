A285361: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + -23*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2018, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
