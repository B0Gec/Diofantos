A140289: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
