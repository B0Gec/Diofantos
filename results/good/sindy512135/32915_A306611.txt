A306611: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = -4, a(1) = 26, a(2) = -49, a(3) = 246, a(4) = -619, a(5) = 2621

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
