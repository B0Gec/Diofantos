A227970: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 28, a(5) = 66, a(6) = 153, a(7) = 276

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
