A164688: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + 42*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 3) + 42*a(n - 4) + 42*a(n - 5) + 42*a(n - 6) + -903*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 44, a(2) = 1892, a(3) = 81356, a(4) = 3498308, a(5) = 150427244, a(6) = 6468371492

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
