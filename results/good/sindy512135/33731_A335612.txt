A335612: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 32, a(1) = 344, a(2) = 2792

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
