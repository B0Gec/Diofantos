A164422: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 60, a(4) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
