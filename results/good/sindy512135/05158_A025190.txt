A025190: 
a(n) = 345*a(n - 4) + 1225*a(n - 3) - 353*a(n - 2) + 33*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -395*a(n - 2) + 1682*a(n - 3) + -1320*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 34, a(2) = 761, a(3) = 14126

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
