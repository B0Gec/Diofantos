A140153: 
a(n) = -a(n - 17) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 34, a(4) = 159, a(5) = 165, a(6) = 508, a(7) = 516, a(8) = 1245

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
