A334908: 
a(n) = 255*a(n - 5) - 944*a(n - 4) - 350*a(n - 3) + 118*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 120*a(n - 2) + -320*a(n - 3) + -1024*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 220, a(3) = 3080

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
