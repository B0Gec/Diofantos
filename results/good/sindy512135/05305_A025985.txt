A025985: 
a(n) = -645*a(n - 5) - 460*a(n - 4) + 806*a(n - 3) - 260*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -278*a(n - 2) + 976*a(n - 3) + -1056*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 563, a(3) = 9241

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
