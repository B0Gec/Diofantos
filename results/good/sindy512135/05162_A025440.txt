A025440: 
a(n) = -68*a(n - 6) - 62*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 105*a(n - 3) - 65*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -80*a(n - 2) + 180*a(n - 3) + -144*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 145, a(3) = 1155

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
