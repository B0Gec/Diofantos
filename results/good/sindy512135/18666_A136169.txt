A136169: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
