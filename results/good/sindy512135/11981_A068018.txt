A068018: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
