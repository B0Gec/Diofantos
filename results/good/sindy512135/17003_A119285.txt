A119285: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 2) - 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = -16, a(4) = 65

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
