A015286: 
a(n) = 368980*a(n - 2) - 2029*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2040*a(n - 1) + 346970*a(n - 2) + 4481880*a(n - 3) + -4826809*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2040, a(2) = 4508570, a(3) = -9900819720

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
