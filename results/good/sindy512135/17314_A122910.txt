 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A122910: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 5) - 18*a(n - 4) - 54*a(n - 3) + 26*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 24*a(n - 2) + -64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
