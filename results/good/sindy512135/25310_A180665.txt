A180665: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
