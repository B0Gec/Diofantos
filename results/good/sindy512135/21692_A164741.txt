A164741: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 7) + -10*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 150, a(4) = 750, a(5) = 3750, a(6) = 18750, a(7) = 93750

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
