A166913: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 6) + 18*a(n - 5) + 13*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 64*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 357, a(1) = 14450, a(2) = 221650

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
