A025945: 
a(n) = -275*a(n - 5) - 125*a(n - 4) + 347*a(n - 3) - 147*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -161*a(n - 2) + 452*a(n - 3) + -420*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 323, a(3) = 4016

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
