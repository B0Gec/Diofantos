A087330: 
a(n) = -72*a(n - 5) + 57*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 3) - 125*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -141*a(n - 2) + 220*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 370, a(3) = 6150

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
