A042916: 
a(n) = 1762*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1762*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 31, a(1) = 63, a(2) = 409, a(3) = 881, a(4) = 55031, a(5) = 110943, a(6) = 720689, a(7) = 1552321

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
