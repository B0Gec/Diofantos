A290471: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) + a(n - 10) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 31, a(5) = 52, a(6) = 99, a(7) = 169, a(8) = 301

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
