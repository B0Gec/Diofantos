A281698: 
a(n) = -26*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) + 26*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 3) - 42*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 92*a(n - 3) + -48*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 55, a(3) = 269

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
