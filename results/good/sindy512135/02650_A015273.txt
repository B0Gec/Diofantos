A015273: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) + 180*a(n - 3) + 7771*a(n - 2) - 180*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -185*a(n - 1) + 6882*a(n - 2) + 39960*a(n - 3) + -46656*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -185, a(2) = 41107, a(3) = -8838005

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
