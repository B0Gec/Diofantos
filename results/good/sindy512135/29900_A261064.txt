A261064: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 100

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
