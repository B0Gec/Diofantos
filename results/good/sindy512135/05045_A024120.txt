a(n) = -16*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -91*a(n - 2) + 245*a(n - 3) + -385*a(n - 4) + 371*a(n - 5) + -217*a(n - 6) + 71*a(n - 7) + -10*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 271, a(4) = 5904, a(5) = 84375, a(6) = 953344, a(7) = 9882351

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
