A164666: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + 28*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + 28*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 5) + 28*a(n - 6) + -406*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 870, a(3) = 25230, a(4) = 731670, a(5) = 21218430, a(6) = 615334470

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
