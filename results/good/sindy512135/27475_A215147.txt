A215147: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 11) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 30

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
