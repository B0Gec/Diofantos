A022000: 
a(n) = 61*a(n - 5) + 196*a(n - 4) + 437*a(n - 3) - 213*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -251*a(n - 2) + 752*a(n - 3) + -528*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 533, a(3) = 8648

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
