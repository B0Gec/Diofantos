A097121: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
