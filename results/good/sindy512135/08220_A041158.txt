A041158: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + 1000*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1000*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 66, a(3) = 217, a(4) = 500, a(5) = 9217, a(6) = 18934, a(7) = 66019, a(8) = 216991, a(9) = 500001
