A180343: 
a(n) = -a(n - 17) - a(n - 13) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = -4, a(1) = -2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -4, a(4) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
