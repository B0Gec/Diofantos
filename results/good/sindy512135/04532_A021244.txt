A021244: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 5) + 74*a(n - 4) + 83*a(n - 3) - 100*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -133*a(n - 2) + 267*a(n - 3) + -154*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 308, a(3) = 3942

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
