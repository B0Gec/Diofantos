A200783: 
a(n) = -26*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -35*a(n - 3) + 35*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -7*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 49, a(3) = 308, a(4) = 1946, a(5) = 12152, a(6) = 75992

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
