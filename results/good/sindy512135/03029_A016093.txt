A016093: 
a(n) = -975*a(n - 6) - 3808*a(n - 5) - 8942*a(n - 4) + 3971*a(n - 3) - 610*a(n - 2) + 41*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 1) + -626*a(n - 2) + 4216*a(n - 3) + -10560*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 41, a(2) = 1055, a(3) = 21805

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
