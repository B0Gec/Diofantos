A253072: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 13*a(n - 5) + 24*a(n - 4) - 25*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 44*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 95, a(4) = 333

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
