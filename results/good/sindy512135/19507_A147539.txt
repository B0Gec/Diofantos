A147539: 
a(n) = -178*a(n - 5) + 43*a(n - 4) + 293*a(n - 3) - 183*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -202*a(n - 2) + 432*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 99, a(2) = 1799, a(3) = 30735

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
