A229135: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) + 12*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 22*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
