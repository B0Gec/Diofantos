A195116: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 7) - 7*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 4) + 18*a(n - 3) - 31*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 72*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 77, a(3) = 319

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
