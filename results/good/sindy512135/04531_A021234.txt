A021234: 
a(n) = 39*a(n - 5) + 67*a(n - 4) + 74*a(n - 3) - 91*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -123*a(n - 2) + 244*a(n - 3) + -140*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 277, a(3) = 3324

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
