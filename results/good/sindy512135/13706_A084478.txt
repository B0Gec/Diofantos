A084478: 
a(n) = -221*a(n - 5) + 218*a(n - 4) + 220*a(n - 3) + 102*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 103*a(n - 2) + 280*a(n - 3) + 380*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 384

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
