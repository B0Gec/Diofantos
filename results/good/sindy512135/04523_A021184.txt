A021184: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 6) + 28*a(n - 5) + 45*a(n - 4) + 44*a(n - 3) - 64*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -92*a(n - 2) + 172*a(n - 3) + -96*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 197, a(3) = 1957

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
