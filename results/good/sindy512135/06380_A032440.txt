A032440: 
a(n) = -11*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -16*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 26, a(6) = 93

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
