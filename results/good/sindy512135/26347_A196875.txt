A196875: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
