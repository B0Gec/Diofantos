A106850: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -25*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 174

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
