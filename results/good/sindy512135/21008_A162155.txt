A162155: 
a(n) = -a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 83, a(6) = 82, a(7) = 13, a(8) = 2, a(9) = 219, a(10) = 218

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
