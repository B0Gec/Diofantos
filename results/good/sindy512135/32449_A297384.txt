A297384: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 29*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 52*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 44, a(2) = 372, a(3) = 2932

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
