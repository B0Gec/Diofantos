A061506: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 120, a(2) = 1008, a(3) = 1320, a(4) = 5460, a(5) = 4896, a(6) = 15960, a(7) = 12144

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
