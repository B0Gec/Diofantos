A020525: 
a(n) = -1287*a(n - 5) - 318*a(n - 4) + 2277*a(n - 3) - 723*a(n - 2) + 52*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 53*a(n - 1) + -756*a(n - 2) + 2752*a(n - 3) + -2048*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 847, a(3) = 45375

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
