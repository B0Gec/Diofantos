A151610: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 5) - 208*a(n - 4) + 241*a(n - 3) - 115*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -115*a(n - 2) + 241*a(n - 3) + -208*a(n - 4) + 64*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 252, a(2) = 4935, a(3) = 56560, a(4) = 572215

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
