A292494: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 88, a(4) = 362, a(5) = 1470

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
