A021544: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 5) + 78*a(n - 4) + 113*a(n - 3) - 91*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -119*a(n - 2) + 269*a(n - 3) + -168*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 242, a(3) = 2606

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
