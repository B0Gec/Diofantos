A164628: 
a(n) = -52*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 6) + -120*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 272, a(3) = 4352, a(4) = 69632, a(5) = 1114112, a(6) = 17825792

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
