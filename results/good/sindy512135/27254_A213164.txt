A213164: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 3) + -33*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 51, a(3) = 235, a(4) = 966

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
