A178299: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 5) + 169*a(n - 4) + 538*a(n - 3) - 217*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -476*a(n - 2) + 2736*a(n - 3) + -5760*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 234, a(3) = 2820

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
