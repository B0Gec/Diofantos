A028124: 
a(n) = -944*a(n - 5) - 1176*a(n - 4) + 1043*a(n - 3) - 266*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -281*a(n - 2) + 1190*a(n - 3) + -1800*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 503, a(3) = 7406

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
