A025976: 
a(n) = -364*a(n - 5) - 217*a(n - 4) + 453*a(n - 3) - 167*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -182*a(n - 2) + 568*a(n - 3) + -576*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 347, a(3) = 4363

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
