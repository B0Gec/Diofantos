a(n) = -15*a(n - 4) - 207*a(n - 3) - 2686*a(n - 2) + 208*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 209*a(n - 1) + -2926*a(n - 2) + 2926*a(n - 3) + -209*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 1980, a(2) = 378840, a(3) = 73419192, a(4) = 14241916260

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
