A028188: 
a(n) = -1891*a(n - 5) - 3205*a(n - 4) + 2021*a(n - 3) - 404*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -419*a(n - 2) + 2210*a(n - 3) + -4200*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 34, a(2) = 737, a(3) = 13022

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
