A015224: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 126, a(5) = 196, a(6) = 288, a(7) = 550, a(8) = 726, a(9) = 936

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
