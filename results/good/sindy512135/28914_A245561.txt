A245561: 
a(n) = -14*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + 17*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 27*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 55*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
