A025031: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 5) + 300*a(n - 4) + 988*a(n - 3) - 309*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -349*a(n - 2) + 1398*a(n - 3) + -1080*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 675, a(3) = 11830

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
