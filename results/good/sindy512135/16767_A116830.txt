A116830: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) - 5*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -7*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 72, a(5) = 229

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
