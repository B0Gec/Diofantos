A028208: 
a(n) = -2165*a(n - 5) - 3973*a(n - 4) + 2292*a(n - 3) - 433*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -448*a(n - 2) + 2484*a(n - 3) + -5040*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 777, a(3) = 13999

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
