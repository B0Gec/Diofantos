A021524: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 6) + 39*a(n - 5) + 90*a(n - 4) + 134*a(n - 3) - 105*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -137*a(n - 2) + 315*a(n - 3) + -198*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 304, a(3) = 3822

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
