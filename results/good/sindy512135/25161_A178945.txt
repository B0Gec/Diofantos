A178945: 
a(n) = a(n - 11) + 2*a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
