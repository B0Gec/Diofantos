A030113: 
a(n) = -15*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6) + -8*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 45, a(3) = 285, a(4) = 1695, a(5) = 10317, a(6) = 62349, a(7) = 377739, a(8) = 2286648
