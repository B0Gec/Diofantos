A289802: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 53, a(4) = 185, a(5) = 643, a(6) = 2234, a(7) = 7764

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
