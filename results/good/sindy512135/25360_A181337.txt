A181337: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 123

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
