A133629: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) - a(n - 18) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
