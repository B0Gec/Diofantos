A024170: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 5) + 185*a(n - 4) + 466*a(n - 3) - 195*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -229*a(n - 2) + 744*a(n - 3) + -540*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 447, a(3) = 6412

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
