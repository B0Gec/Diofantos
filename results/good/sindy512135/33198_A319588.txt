A319588: 
a(n) = -970*a(n - 4) + 108*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 108*a(n - 2) + -108*a(n - 3) + -982*a(n - 4) + 982*a(n - 5) + 108*a(n - 6) + -108*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 105, a(3) = 2016, a(4) = 11628, a(5) = 203203, a(6) = 1152921, a(7) = 19968040, a(8) = 113108320
