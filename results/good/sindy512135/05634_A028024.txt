A028024: 
a(n) = -1465*a(n - 5) - 1507*a(n - 4) + 1807*a(n - 3) - 409*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -428*a(n - 2) + 2044*a(n - 3) + -2640*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 797, a(3) = 14959

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
