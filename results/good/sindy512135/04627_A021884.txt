A021884: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 5) + 126*a(n - 4) + 240*a(n - 3) - 139*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -171*a(n - 2) + 457*a(n - 3) + -308*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 358, a(3) = 4758

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
