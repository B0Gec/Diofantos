A026727: 
a(n) = -633*a(n - 5) - 499*a(n - 4) + 781*a(n - 3) - 236*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -252*a(n - 2) + 932*a(n - 3) + -1056*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 477, a(3) = 7007

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
