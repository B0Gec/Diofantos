A274325: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -9*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 122, a(4) = 513, a(5) = 1563, a(6) = 3889

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
