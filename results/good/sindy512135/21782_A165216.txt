A165216: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 8) + -28*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 576, a(4) = 4608, a(5) = 36864, a(6) = 294912, a(7) = 2359296, a(8) = 18874368
