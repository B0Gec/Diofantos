A011915: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 10) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 7) + -4*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 24, a(6) = 72, a(7) = 168, a(8) = 336

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
