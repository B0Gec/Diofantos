A291032: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 68*a(n - 3) + -87*a(n - 4) + 68*a(n - 5) + -33*a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 54, a(4) = 188, a(5) = 645, a(6) = 2208, a(7) = 7570

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
