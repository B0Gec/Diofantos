A025984: 
a(n) = -590*a(n - 5) - 411*a(n - 4) + 737*a(n - 3) - 243*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -260*a(n - 2) + 896*a(n - 3) + -960*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 524, a(3) = 8288

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
