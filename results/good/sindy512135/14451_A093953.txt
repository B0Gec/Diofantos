A093953: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 63

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
