A224332: 
a(n) = -48*a(n - 5) + 40*a(n - 4) + 75*a(n - 3) - 84*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -97*a(n - 2) + 144*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 381, a(3) = 4092

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
