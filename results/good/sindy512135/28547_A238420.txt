A238420: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 120, a(5) = 390

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
