A289419: 
a(n) = -15*a(n - 7) - 11*a(n - 6) + 15*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -46*a(n - 2) + 91*a(n - 3) + -86*a(n - 4) + 34*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 75, a(3) = 410, a(4) = 1975, a(5) = 8778

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
