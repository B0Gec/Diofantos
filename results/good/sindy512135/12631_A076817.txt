A076817: 
a(n) = a(n - 12)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 50, a(5) = 25, a(6) = 8, a(7) = 8, a(8) = 25, a(9) = 50, a(10) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
