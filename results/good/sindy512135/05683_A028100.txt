A028100: 
a(n) = -1235*a(n - 5) - 1560*a(n - 4) + 1391*a(n - 3) - 327*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -343*a(n - 2) + 1569*a(n - 3) + -2376*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 618, a(3) = 10094

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
