A203171: 
a(n) = -322*a(n - 2) - 54*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -55*a(n - 1) + -385*a(n - 2) + -385*a(n - 3) + -55*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 80, a(3) = -4016, a(4) = 190465

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
