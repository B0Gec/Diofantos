A292059: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 42, a(3) = 104, a(4) = 251, a(5) = 464, a(6) = 852, a(7) = 1360

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
