A003737: 
a(n) = 84*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + 50*a(n - 2) + -80*a(n - 3) + -120*a(n - 4) + 188*a(n - 5) + 32*a(n - 6) + -16*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 92, a(2) = 1432, a(3) = 22632, a(4) = 357952, a(5) = 5660752, a(6) = 89521984

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
