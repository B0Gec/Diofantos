A091692: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 5) + 40*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 105*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -141*a(n - 2) + 220*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 121, a(3) = 1332

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
