A027974: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
