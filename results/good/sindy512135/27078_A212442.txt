A212442: 
a(n) = 39*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 76*a(n - 2) + 136*a(n - 3) + -38*a(n - 4) + -136*a(n - 5) + 76*a(n - 6) + -8*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 140, a(3) = 1864, a(4) = 26602, a(5) = 373080, a(6) = 5253564, a(7) = 73911192

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
