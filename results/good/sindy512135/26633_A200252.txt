A200252: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 45, a(4) = 75, a(5) = 112

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
