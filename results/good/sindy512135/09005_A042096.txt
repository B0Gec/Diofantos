A042096: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 574*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 574*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 23, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 263, a(3) = 287, a(4) = 13465, a(5) = 13752, a(6) = 150985, a(7) = 164737

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
