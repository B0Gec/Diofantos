A225030: 
a(n) = -567*a(n - 5) - 516*a(n - 4) + 655*a(n - 3) - 203*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -218*a(n - 2) + 782*a(n - 3) + -973*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 193, a(4) = 1441

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
