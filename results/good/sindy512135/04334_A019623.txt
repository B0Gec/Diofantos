 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A019623: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 5) + 126*a(n - 4) + 240*a(n - 3) - 139*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -149*a(n - 2) + 308*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 335

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
