A028043: 
a(n) = -509*a(n - 5) - 447*a(n - 4) + 588*a(n - 3) - 189*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -203*a(n - 2) + 708*a(n - 3) + -864*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 373, a(3) = 4788

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
