A025943: 
a(n) = -222*a(n - 5) - 91*a(n - 4) + 279*a(n - 3) - 124*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -137*a(n - 2) + 370*a(n - 3) + -336*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 263, a(3) = 2890

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
