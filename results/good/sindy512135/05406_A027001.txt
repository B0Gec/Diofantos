A027001: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 3) + -19*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 174, a(3) = 743, a(4) = 2552, a(5) = 7784

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
