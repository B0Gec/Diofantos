A071952: 
a(n) = -1628*a(n - 5) - 1582*a(n - 4) + 2018*a(n - 3) - 485*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + -508*a(n - 2) + 2304*a(n - 3) + -2880*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 40, a(2) = 1092, a(3) = 25664

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
