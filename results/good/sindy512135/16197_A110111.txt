A110111: 
a(n) = 155*a(n - 5) - 689*a(n - 4) - 207*a(n - 3) + 83*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 84*a(n - 2) + -189*a(n - 3) + -729*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 133

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
