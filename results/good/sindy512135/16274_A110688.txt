A110688: 
a(n) = -11*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) - 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -4, a(3) = 19, a(4) = -73

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
