 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A016290: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 6) + 21*a(n - 5) + 30*a(n - 4) + 23*a(n - 3) - 45*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 140

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
