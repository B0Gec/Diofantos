A007983: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 7, a(6) = 10, a(7) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
