A199774: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 66*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 66*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 32, a(4) = 203, a(5) = 333

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
