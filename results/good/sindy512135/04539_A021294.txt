A021294: 
a(n) = 52*a(n - 5) + 93*a(n - 4) + 113*a(n - 3) - 125*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -161*a(n - 2) + 337*a(n - 3) + -198*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 368, a(3) = 5098

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
