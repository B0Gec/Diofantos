A028096: 
a(n) = -1209*a(n - 5) - 1504*a(n - 4) + 1363*a(n - 3) - 325*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + -341*a(n - 2) + 1541*a(n - 3) + -2310*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 620, a(3) = 10190

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
