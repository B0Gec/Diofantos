A042578: 
a(n) = -44*a(n - 10) + 286*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 286*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 28, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 57, a(3) = 86, a(4) = 143, a(5) = 8094, a(6) = 8237, a(7) = 16331, a(8) = 24568, a(9) = 40899
