A021804: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 30*a(n - 5) + 75*a(n - 4) + 119*a(n - 3) - 85*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -111*a(n - 2) + 262*a(n - 3) + -168*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 213, a(3) = 2098

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
