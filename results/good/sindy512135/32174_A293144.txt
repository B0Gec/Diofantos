A293144: 
a(n) = -322*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + 541*a(n - 3) - 254*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -275*a(n - 2) + 724*a(n - 3) + -480*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 64, a(2) = 896, a(3) = 15616

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
