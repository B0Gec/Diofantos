A115271: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 12, a(6) = 16, a(7) = 20, a(8) = 29, a(9) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
