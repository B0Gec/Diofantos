A028055: 
a(n) = -476*a(n - 5) - 424*a(n - 4) + 546*a(n - 3) - 175*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -189*a(n - 2) + 657*a(n - 3) + -810*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 340, a(3) = 4130

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
