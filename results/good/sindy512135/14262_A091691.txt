A091691: 
a(n) = -70*a(n - 5) + 52*a(n - 4) + 112*a(n - 3) - 124*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -141*a(n - 2) + 220*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -8, a(3) = -77

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
