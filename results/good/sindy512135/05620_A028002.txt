A028002: 
a(n) = -779*a(n - 5) - 655*a(n - 4) + 962*a(n - 3) - 273*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -290*a(n - 2) + 1132*a(n - 3) + -1320*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 551, a(3) = 8701

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
