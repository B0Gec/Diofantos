A178742: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
