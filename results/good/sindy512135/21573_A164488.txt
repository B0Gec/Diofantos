A164488: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 52, a(4) = 81, a(5) = 126, a(6) = 195

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
