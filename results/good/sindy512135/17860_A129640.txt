A129640: 
a(n) = -a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 155, a(2) = 464, a(3) = 939, a(4) = 1764, a(5) = 3515, a(6) = 6260

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
