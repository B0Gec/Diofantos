A180153: 
a(n) = 1605*a(n - 4) + 7539*a(n - 3) - 1883*a(n - 2) + 118*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 121*a(n - 1) + -2220*a(n - 2) + 12100*a(n - 3) + -10000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 121, a(2) = 12421, a(3) = 1246421

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
