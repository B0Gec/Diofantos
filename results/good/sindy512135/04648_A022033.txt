A022033: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 31*a(n - 5) + 89*a(n - 4) + 159*a(n - 3) - 98*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -125*a(n - 2) + 317*a(n - 3) + -210*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 236, a(3) = 2426

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
