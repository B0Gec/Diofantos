A224251: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - a(n - 16) + a(n - 8) + 5*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 23, a(4) = 48

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
