A291392: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 13*a(n - 3) - 43*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + -72*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 90, a(3) = 765

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
