A093652: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 8) - 6*a(n - 6) - 10*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 2020, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 45, a(6) = 86, a(7) = 239

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
