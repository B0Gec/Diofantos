A241030: 
a(n) = -456*a(n - 5) + 62*a(n - 4) + 783*a(n - 3) - 429*a(n - 2) + 41*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -457*a(n - 2) + 1092*a(n - 3) + -676*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 42, a(2) = 850, a(3) = 19782

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
