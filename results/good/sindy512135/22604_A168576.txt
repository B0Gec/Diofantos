A168576: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 9648*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11111*a(n - 1) + -11222110*a(n - 2) + 1122211000*a(n - 3) + -11111000000*a(n - 4) + 10000000000*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 16, a(1) = 14641, a(2) = 104060401, a(3) = 1004006004001, a(4) = 10004000600040001

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
