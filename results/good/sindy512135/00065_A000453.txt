 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A000453: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 14*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 350

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
