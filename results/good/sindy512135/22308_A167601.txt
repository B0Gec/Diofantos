 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A167601: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 5) - 39*a(n - 4) + 184*a(n - 3) + 39*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 40*a(n - 2) + 192*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 49

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
