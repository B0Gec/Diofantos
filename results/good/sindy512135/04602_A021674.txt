A021674: 
a(n) = 51*a(n - 5) + 125*a(n - 4) + 209*a(n - 3) - 144*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -179*a(n - 2) + 444*a(n - 3) + -288*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 397, a(3) = 5676

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
