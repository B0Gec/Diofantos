A021504: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 6) + 33*a(n - 5) + 75*a(n - 4) + 106*a(n - 3) - 88*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -117*a(n - 2) + 261*a(n - 3) + -162*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 244, a(3) = 2674

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
