A021994: 
a(n) = 57*a(n - 5) + 181*a(n - 4) + 394*a(n - 3) - 197*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -234*a(n - 2) + 688*a(n - 3) + -480*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 495, a(3) = 7735

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
