A127222: 
a(n) = -81*a(n - 6) + 216*a(n - 5) + 72*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + 81*a(n - 4) + 243*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 189, a(3) = 1215, a(4) = 7533

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
