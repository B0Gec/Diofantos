A236377: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 35, a(5) = 59, a(6) = 84, a(7) = 132, a(8) = 213

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
