A123955: 
a(n) = -55*a(n - 6) - 47*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 4) + 82*a(n - 3) - 55*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -86*a(n - 2) + 234*a(n - 3) + -300*a(n - 4) + 144*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
