A164672: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + 34*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + 34*a(n - 4) + 34*a(n - 5) + 34*a(n - 6) + -595*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 1260, a(3) = 44100, a(4) = 1543500, a(5) = 54022500, a(6) = 1890787500

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
