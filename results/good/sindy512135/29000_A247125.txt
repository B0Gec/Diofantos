A247125: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + 11*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
