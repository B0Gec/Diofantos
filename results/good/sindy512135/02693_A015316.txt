a(n) = a(n - 2) - 99900*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -90909*a(n - 1) + 918281910*a(n - 2) + 917272809000*a(n - 3) + -91828191000000*a(n - 4) + -909090000000000*a(n - 5) + 1000000000000000*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -90909, a(2) = 9182728191, a(3) = -917355454462809, a(4) = 91744720010017447191, a(5) = -9174380256281734701652809
