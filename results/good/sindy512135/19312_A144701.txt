A144701: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -16*a(n - 3) + -19*a(n - 4) + -16*a(n - 5) + -10*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -9, a(2) = 26, a(3) = -25, a(4) = -36, a(5) = 133, a(6) = -132, a(7) = -81

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
