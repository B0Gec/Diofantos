A022453: 
a(n) = 39*a(n - 5) + 124*a(n - 4) + 253*a(n - 3) - 134*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -164*a(n - 2) + 458*a(n - 3) + -315*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 320, a(3) = 3890

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
