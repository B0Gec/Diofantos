A041321: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 2902*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2902*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 110, a(4) = 2881, a(5) = 14515, a(6) = 60941, a(7) = 319220

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
