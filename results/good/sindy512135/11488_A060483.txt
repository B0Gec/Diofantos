A060483: 
a(n) = -49*a(n - 6) + 36*a(n - 4) + 63*a(n - 3) - 65*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 148*a(n - 3) + -80*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 57, a(2) = 717, a(3) = 7845

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
