A145405: 
a(n) = 1445*a(n - 2) + 105*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 113*a(n - 1) + 585*a(n - 2) + -10329*a(n - 3) + 17644*a(n - 4) + 3148*a(n - 5) + -8496*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 20, a(1) = 2984, a(2) = 340852, a(3) = 40071100, a(4) = 4696965476, a(5) = 550730736140

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
