A291387: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 14*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -32*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 56, a(2) = 352, a(3) = 2096

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
