A178298: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 5) + 123*a(n - 4) + 450*a(n - 3) - 202*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -416*a(n - 2) + 2174*a(n - 3) + -4095*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 152, a(3) = 1858

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
