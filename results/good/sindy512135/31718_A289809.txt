A289809: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 38, a(4) = 114, a(5) = 354, a(6) = 1076, a(7) = 3311

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
