A275635: 
a(n) = -482*a(n - 5) - 15*a(n - 4) + 822*a(n - 3) - 364*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + -390*a(n - 2) + 1080*a(n - 3) + -729*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 780

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
