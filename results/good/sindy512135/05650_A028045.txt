A028045: 
a(n) = -614*a(n - 5) - 566*a(n - 4) + 709*a(n - 3) - 218*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -233*a(n - 2) + 844*a(n - 3) + -1056*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 443, a(3) = 6304

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
