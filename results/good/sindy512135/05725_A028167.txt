A028167: 
a(n) = -1049*a(n - 5) - 1460*a(n - 4) + 1137*a(n - 3) - 273*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -287*a(n - 2) + 1280*a(n - 3) + -2100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 497, a(3) = 7160

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
