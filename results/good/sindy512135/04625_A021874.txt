A021874: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 5) + 116*a(n - 4) + 216*a(n - 3) - 128*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -159*a(n - 2) + 418*a(n - 3) + -280*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 325, a(3) = 4070

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
