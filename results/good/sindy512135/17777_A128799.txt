A128799: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 6) + 24*a(n - 5) + 58*a(n - 4) + 84*a(n - 3) - 66*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -75*a(n - 2) + 125*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 50

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
