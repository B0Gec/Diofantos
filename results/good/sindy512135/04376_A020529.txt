A020529: 
a(n) = -335*a(n - 5) - 29*a(n - 4) + 570*a(n - 3) - 233*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -252*a(n - 2) + 736*a(n - 3) + -512*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 119, a(2) = 4319, a(3) = 94079

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
