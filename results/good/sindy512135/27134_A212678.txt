A212678: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 14, a(6) = 28, a(7) = 53, a(8) = 87

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
