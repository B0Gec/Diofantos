A242558: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 80, a(5) = 220

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
