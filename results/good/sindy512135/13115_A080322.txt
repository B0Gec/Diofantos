A080322: 
a(n) = -a(n - 3) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = -3, a(1) = -9, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 36, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
