A322039: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = -4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
