A239186: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 93, a(3) = 243, a(4) = 492, a(5) = 878, a(6) = 1432, a(7) = 2165

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
