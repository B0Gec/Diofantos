A054421: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 13*a(n - 3) - 43*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -52*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
