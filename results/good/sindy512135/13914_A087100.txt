A087100: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 22, a(5) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
