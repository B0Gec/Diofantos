A093967: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
