A021254: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 5) + 80*a(n - 4) + 91*a(n - 3) - 108*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -143*a(n - 2) + 290*a(n - 3) + -168*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 341, a(3) = 4646

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
