A267450: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -31*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -8*a(n - 7) + 32*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 72, a(4) = 294, a(5) = 1168, a(6) = 4686, a(7) = 18728

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
