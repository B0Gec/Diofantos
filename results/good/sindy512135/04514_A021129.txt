A021129: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 6) + 24*a(n - 5) + 38*a(n - 4) + 33*a(n - 3) - 54*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -81*a(n - 2) + 146*a(n - 3) + -80*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 175, a(3) = 1650

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
