A028131: 
a(n) = -802*a(n - 5) - 974*a(n - 4) + 883*a(n - 3) - 233*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -247*a(n - 2) + 1014*a(n - 3) + -1512*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 429, a(3) = 5746

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
