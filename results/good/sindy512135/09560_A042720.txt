A042720: 
a(n) = 358*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 358*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 29, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 149, a(3) = 179, a(4) = 10531, a(5) = 10710, a(6) = 53371, a(7) = 64081

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
