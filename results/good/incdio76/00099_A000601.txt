 3.7 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A000601: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 11, a(5) = 16, a(6) = 23

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
