While total time consumed by now, scale:12446/34371, seq_id:A074534, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074534: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 3) - 38*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -50*a(n - 2) + 56*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 69

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
