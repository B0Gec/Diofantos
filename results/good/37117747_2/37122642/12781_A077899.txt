 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A077899: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
