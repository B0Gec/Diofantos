While total time consumed by now, scale:12451/34371, seq_id:A074539, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074539: 
a(n) = 80*a(n - 5) + 14*a(n - 4) + 29*a(n - 3) - 52*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -66*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 93

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
