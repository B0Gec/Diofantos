While total time consumed by now, scale:25380/34371, seq_id:A181509, order:20 took:
 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A181509: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 56

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
