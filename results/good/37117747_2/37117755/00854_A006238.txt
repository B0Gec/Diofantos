While total time consumed by now, scale:855/34371, seq_id:A006238, order:20 took:
 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A006238: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 14*a(n - 4) - 17*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -32*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 192, a(3) = 2415

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
