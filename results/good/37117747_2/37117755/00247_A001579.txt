 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A001579: 
a(n) = 90*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) - 49*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 70

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
