While total time consumed by now, scale:324/34371, seq_id:A001882, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A001882: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
