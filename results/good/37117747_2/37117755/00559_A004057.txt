While total time consumed by now, scale:560/34371, seq_id:A004057, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A004057: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 39, a(3) = 191

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
