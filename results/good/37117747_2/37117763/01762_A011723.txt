While total time consumed by now, scale:1763/34371, seq_id:A011723, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A011723: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - 2*a(n - 19) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 13) + 2*a(n - 12) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2016

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
