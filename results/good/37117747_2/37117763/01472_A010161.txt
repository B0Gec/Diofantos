 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A010161: 
a(n) = a(n - 10)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
