While total time consumed by now, scale:2439/34371, seq_id:A014832, order:20 took:
 4.4 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014832: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - 9*a(n - 12) + a(n - 11) - 9*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
