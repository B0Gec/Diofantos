 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014337: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 4) - 24*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
