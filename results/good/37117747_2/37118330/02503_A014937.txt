While total time consumed by now, scale:2504/34371, seq_id:A014937, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014937: 
a(n) = 400*a(n - 12) - 40*a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) - 400*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 1) + -440*a(n - 2) + 400*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 41, a(2) = 1241

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
