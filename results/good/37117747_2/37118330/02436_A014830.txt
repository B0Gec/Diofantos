While total time consumed by now, scale:2437/34371, seq_id:A014830, order:20 took:
 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014830: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 66

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
