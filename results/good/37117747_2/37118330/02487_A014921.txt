While total time consumed by now, scale:2488/34371, seq_id:A014921, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014921: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 13) - 16*a(n - 12) + a(n - 11) - 64*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -80*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 209

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
