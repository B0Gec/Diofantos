A019493: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 44, a(4) = 96, a(5) = 209

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
