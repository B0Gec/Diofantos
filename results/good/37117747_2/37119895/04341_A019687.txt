 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A019687: 
a(n) = 396*a(n - 3) - 179*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -179*a(n - 2) + 396*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 397

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
