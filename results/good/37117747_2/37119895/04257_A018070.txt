 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A018070: 
a(n) = 264*a(n - 3) - 145*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -145*a(n - 2) + 264*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 339

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
