 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A105660: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 49

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
