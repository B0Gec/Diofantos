 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A099580: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
