 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016305: 
a(n) = 96*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) - 60*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -76*a(n - 2) + 96*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 180

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
