While total time consumed by now, scale:16341/34371, seq_id:A111926, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A111926: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
