 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A118101: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 18) + a(n - 16) + 16*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 17*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 119

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
