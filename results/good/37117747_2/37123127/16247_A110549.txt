A110549: 
a(n) = a(n - 16)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 4, a(6) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
