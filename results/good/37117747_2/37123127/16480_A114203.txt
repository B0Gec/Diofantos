While total time consumed by now, scale:16481/34371, seq_id:A114203, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A114203: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
