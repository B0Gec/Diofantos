While total time consumed by now, scale:17735/34371, seq_id:A128223, order:20 took:
 4.1 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A128223: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
