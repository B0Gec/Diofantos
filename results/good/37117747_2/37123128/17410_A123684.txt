While total time consumed by now, scale:17411/34371, seq_id:A123684, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A123684: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
