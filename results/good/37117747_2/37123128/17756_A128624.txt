While total time consumed by now, scale:17757/34371, seq_id:A128624, order:20 took:
 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A128624: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 45, a(5) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
