While total time consumed by now, scale:17436/34371, seq_id:A123943, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A123943: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - 5*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 315

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
