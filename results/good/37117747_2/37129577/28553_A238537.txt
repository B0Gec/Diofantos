 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A238537: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) + 202*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + 202*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 42, a(2) = 1379, a(3) = 47124

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
