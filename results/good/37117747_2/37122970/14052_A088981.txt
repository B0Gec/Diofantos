While total time consumed by now, scale:14053/34371, seq_id:A088981, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A088981: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
