 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163231: 
a(n) = -946*a(n - 4) + 43*a(n - 3) + 43*a(n - 2) + 43*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 1) + 43*a(n - 2) + 43*a(n - 3) + -946*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 45, a(2) = 1980, a(3) = 87120

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
