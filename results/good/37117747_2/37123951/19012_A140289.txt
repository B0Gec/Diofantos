 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A140289: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
