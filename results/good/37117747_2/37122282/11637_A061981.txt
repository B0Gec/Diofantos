While total time consumed by now, scale:11638/34371, seq_id:A061981, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A061981: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
