 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064753: 
a(n) = 49*a(n - 6) - 14*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 49*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 49*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 97, a(2) = 1028

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
