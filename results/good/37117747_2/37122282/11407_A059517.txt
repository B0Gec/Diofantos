 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A059517: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 7) - 9*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 18*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
