 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A163941: 
a(n) = -18*a(n - 4) + 39*a(n - 3) - 29*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 52, a(3) = 246

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
