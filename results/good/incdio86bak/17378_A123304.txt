 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A123304: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 263

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
