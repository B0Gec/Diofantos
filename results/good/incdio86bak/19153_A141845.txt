 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A141845: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 194, a(4) = 976, a(5) = 4887

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
