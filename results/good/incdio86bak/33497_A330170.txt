 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A330170: 
a(n) = -36*a(n - 4) + 72*a(n - 3) - 47*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 72*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 250, a(3) = 1392

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
