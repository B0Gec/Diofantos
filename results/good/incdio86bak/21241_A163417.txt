A163417: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -1, a(3) = -4, a(4) = -6

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
