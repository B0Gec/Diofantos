A321048: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 12, a(5) = 24

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
