A156269: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 6) - 8*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -16*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = -20, a(4) = -24, a(5) = -56

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
