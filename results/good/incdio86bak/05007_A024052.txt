 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A024052: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 5) - 21*a(n - 4) + 34*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + -21*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 98, a(4) = 561

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
