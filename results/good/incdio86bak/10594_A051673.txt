 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A051673: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 47

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
