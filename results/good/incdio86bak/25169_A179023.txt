A179023: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 28, a(5) = 60

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
