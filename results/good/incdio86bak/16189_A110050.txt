 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A110050: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) - 24*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 73, a(3) = 369, a(4) = 1697

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
