A232602: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) - 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 30, a(3) = -186, a(4) = 838

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
