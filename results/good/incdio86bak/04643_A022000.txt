 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A022000: 
a(n) = -528*a(n - 4) + 752*a(n - 3) - 251*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -251*a(n - 2) + 752*a(n - 3) + -528*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 533, a(3) = 8648

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
