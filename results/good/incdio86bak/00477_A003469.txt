 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A003469: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 16*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 65, a(4) = 171

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
