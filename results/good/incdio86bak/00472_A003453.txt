 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A003453: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 17, a(5) = 26

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
