A135266: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 19, a(4) = 60

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
