 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A192874: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 26

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
