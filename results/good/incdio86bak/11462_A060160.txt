 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A060160: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 79

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
