 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A132402: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 15

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
