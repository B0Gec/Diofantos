A236337: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 9

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
