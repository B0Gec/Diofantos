 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A033622: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 41, a(4) = 109

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
