 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291386: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 4) - 18*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -18*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 54, a(3) = 252

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
