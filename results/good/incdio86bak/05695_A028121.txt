A028121: 
a(n) = -1600*a(n - 4) + 1080*a(n - 3) - 262*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -262*a(n - 2) + 1080*a(n - 3) + -1600*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 467, a(3) = 6615

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
