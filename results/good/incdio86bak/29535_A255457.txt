A255457: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 4) - 24*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 93, a(4) = 359

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
