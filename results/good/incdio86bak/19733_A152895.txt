 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A152895: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 123

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
