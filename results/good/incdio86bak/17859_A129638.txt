 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A129638: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 77, a(4) = 148, a(5) = 286

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
