 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A191903: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 128, a(4) = 312, a(5) = 648

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
