A241527: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 5) - 13*a(n - 4) + 22*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -18*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -13*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 41, a(4) = 105

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
