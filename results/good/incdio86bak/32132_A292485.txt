 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A292485: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 120

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
