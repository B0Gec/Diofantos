 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A038339: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 190, a(3) = 2353, a(4) = 29056

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
