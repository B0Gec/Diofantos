 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A037680: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 102, a(3) = 1023

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
