 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A106521: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 20*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 20*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 18, a(1) = 38, a(2) = 456, a(3) = 854, a(4) = 9192

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
