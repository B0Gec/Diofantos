 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A188696: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) + 26*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 676, a(3) = 17576

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
