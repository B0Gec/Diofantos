 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192845: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 56, a(2) = 180, a(3) = 400

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
