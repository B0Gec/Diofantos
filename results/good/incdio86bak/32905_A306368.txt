A306368: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 28, a(5) = 12, a(6) = 45, a(7) = 55, a(8) = 22

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
