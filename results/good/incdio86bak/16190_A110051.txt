 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A110051: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) - 24*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 119, a(4) = 599

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
