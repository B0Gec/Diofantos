A122589: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 21*a(n - 5) - 70*a(n - 4) + 84*a(n - 3) - 45*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + 84*a(n - 3) + -70*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 76, a(3) = 425, a(4) = 2109, a(5) = 9709

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
