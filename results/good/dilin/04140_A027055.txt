A027055: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 59, a(3) = 146, a(4) = 319, a(5) = 652

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
