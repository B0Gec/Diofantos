A163201: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 21*a(n - 3) - 56*a(n - 2) - 21*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 26, a(3) = -486, a(4) = 8775

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
