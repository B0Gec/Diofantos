A213484: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
