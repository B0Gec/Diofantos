A102650: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 12
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 56, a(4) = 116

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
