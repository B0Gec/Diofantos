a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
