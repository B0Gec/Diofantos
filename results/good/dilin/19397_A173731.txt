A173731: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 23*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 33*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 88

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
