a(n) = 10*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 17
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 235, a(3) = 2357, a(4) = 23572

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
