A123194: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 23, a(4) = 43

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
