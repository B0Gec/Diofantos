A116793: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 74

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
