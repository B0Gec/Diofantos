A073949: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 5) - 36*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 30

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
