A197424: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 19*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 225, a(3) = 1600, a(4) = 10816

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
