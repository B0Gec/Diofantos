A284699: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 57, a(3) = 223, a(4) = 863

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
