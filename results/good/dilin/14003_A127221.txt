A127221: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 56, a(3) = 240, a(4) = 992

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
