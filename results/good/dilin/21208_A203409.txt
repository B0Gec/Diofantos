A203409: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 1442*a(n - 2) - 432
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1442*a(n - 2) + -1442*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 1075, a(3) = 21201, a(4) = 1549717

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
