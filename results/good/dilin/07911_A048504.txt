A048504: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -25*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 3) + -28*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
