A256321: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 25
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 19, a(4) = 33, a(5) = 52

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
