a(n) = -6*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 30
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 189, a(4) = 1232

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
