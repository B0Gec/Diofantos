A264891: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 375
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 112, a(3) = 783, a(4) = 2839

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
