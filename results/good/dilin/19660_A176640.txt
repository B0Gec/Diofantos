A176640: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 5) + -8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 46, a(5) = 111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
