A234617: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 28*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 9
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -37*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + -52*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 107, a(3) = 380, a(4) = 1345

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
