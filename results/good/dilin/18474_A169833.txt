A169833: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 20
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 170, a(3) = 596, a(4) = 1690

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
