A138721: 
a(n) = 1000000*a(n - 3) - 111000*a(n - 2) + 1110*a(n - 1) + 98901
truth: 
a(n) = 1111*a(n - 1) + -112110*a(n - 2) + 1111000*a(n - 3) + -1000000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 101, a(1) = 110011, a(2) = 111000111, a(3) = 111100001111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
