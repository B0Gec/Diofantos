A291031: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) - 27*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 27*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3) + -27*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 70, a(3) = 321, a(4) = 1461, a(5) = 6624

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
