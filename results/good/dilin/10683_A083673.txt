A083673: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 12
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 7, a(6) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
