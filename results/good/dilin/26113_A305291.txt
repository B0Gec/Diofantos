A305291: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1) - 12
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = -32, a(3) = 85, a(4) = -183

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
