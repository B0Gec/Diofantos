A215097: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 26, a(4) = 56, a(5) = 99

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
