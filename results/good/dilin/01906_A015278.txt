A015278: 
a(n) = 1000000*a(n - 3) + 91000*a(n - 2) - 910*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = -909*a(n - 1) + 91910*a(n - 2) + 909000*a(n - 3) + -1000000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -909, a(2) = 918191, a(3) = -917272809

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
