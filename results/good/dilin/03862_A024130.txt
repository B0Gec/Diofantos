a(n) = -11*a(n - 4) + 34*a(n - 3) - 36*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1) + 60
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -50*a(n - 2) + 70*a(n - 3) + -45*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 113, a(3) = 1304, a(4) = 14577

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
