 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A072708: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 21, a(1) = 39, a(2) = 42, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 81

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
