 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A110269: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
