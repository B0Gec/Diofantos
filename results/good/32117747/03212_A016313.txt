 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016313: 
a(n) = 140*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 85*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -104*a(n - 2) + 140*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 257

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
