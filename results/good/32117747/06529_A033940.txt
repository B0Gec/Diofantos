While total time consumed by now, scale:6530/34371, seq_id:A033940, order:20 took:
 3.2 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A033940: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
