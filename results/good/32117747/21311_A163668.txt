 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163668: 
a(n) = -703*a(n - 5) + 37*a(n - 4) + 37*a(n - 3) + 37*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37*a(n - 1) + 37*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 3) + 37*a(n - 4) + -703*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 39, a(2) = 1482, a(3) = 56316, a(4) = 2140008

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
