 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A037517: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 129, a(3) = 1034

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
