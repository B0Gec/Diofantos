 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A164416: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 69, a(4) = 120

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
