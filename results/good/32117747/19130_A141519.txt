 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A141519: 
a(n) = a(n - 20)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = -5, a(5) = 3, a(6) = -7, a(7) = 9, a(8) = -9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
