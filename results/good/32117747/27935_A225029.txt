 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A225029: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 73*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 3) - 45*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -59*a(n - 2) + 74*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 103

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
