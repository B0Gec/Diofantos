While total time consumed by now, scale:15712/34371, seq_id:A105693, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A105693: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
