While total time consumed by now, scale:16189/34371, seq_id:A110048, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A110048: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
