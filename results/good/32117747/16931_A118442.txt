 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A118442: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -4, a(3) = -12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
