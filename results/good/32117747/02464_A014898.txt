While total time consumed by now, scale:2465/34371, seq_id:A014898, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014898: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 15*a(n - 9) - 14*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 258

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
