While total time consumed by now, scale:12454/34371, seq_id:A074542, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A074542: 
a(n) = 96*a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 61*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -76*a(n - 2) + 96*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 104

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
