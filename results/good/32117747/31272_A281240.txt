 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A281240: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 144, a(2) = 480, a(3) = 816, a(4) = 1344, a(5) = 3024

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
