While total time consumed by now, scale:15175/34371, seq_id:A099786, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A099786: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 28*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
