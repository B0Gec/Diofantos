 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A077917: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 14) + 2*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
