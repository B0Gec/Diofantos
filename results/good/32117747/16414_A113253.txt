 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A113253: 
a(n) = 2401*a(n - 4) + 196*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 196*a(n - 3) + 2401*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 131, a(3) = 1681

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
