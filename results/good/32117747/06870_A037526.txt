 3.7 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A037526: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 9*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 171, a(3) = 1541

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
