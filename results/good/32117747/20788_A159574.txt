A159574: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 313, a(1) = 337, a(2) = 365, a(3) = 1513, a(4) = 1685, a(5) = 1877

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
