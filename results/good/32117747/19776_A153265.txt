 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A153265: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) - 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -9, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
