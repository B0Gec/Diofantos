While total time consumed by now, scale:2480/34371, seq_id:A014913, order:20 took:
 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014913: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 24*a(n - 9) - 23*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -49*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 627

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
