While total time consumed by now, scale:28581/34371, seq_id:A238976, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A238976: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 6) - 12*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 27*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
