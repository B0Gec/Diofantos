 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A285397: 
a(n) = 216*a(n - 5) + 21*a(n - 4) + 53*a(n - 3) - 164*a(n - 2) + 31*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -195*a(n - 2) + 216*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 646

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
