 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A266797: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 32*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -44*a(n - 2) + 48*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
