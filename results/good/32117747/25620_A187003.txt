 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A187003: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 50

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
