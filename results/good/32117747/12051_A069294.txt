 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A069294: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 4) + 14*a(n - 3) - 34*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -34*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 110, a(2) = 926, a(3) = 7556

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
