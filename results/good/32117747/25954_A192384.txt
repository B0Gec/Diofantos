While total time consumed by now, scale:25955/34371, seq_id:A192384, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192384: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
