While total time consumed by now, scale:12098/34371, seq_id:A069993, order:20 took:
 4.1 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A069993: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 121

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
