 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A123952: 
a(n) = 110*a(n - 4) + 38*a(n - 3) - 57*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -72*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
