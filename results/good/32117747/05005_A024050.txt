While total time consumed by now, scale:5006/34371, seq_id:A024050, order:20 took:
 4.9 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A024050: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) - 5*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 5*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
