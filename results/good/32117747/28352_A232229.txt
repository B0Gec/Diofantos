While total time consumed by now, scale:28353/34371, seq_id:A232229, order:20 took:
 7.2 seconds, i.e. 0.12 minutes or 0.002 hours.

A232229: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - 10*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 10*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 97, a(2) = 905

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
