 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A306755: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 0, a(6) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
