While total time consumed by now, scale:29632/34371, seq_id:A256960, order:20 took:
 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A256960: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) - 5*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
