While total time consumed by now, scale:382/34371, seq_id:A002317, order:20 took:
 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A002317: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 7, a(3) = -26

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
