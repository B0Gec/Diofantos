 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A176593: 
a(n) = -a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 26

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
