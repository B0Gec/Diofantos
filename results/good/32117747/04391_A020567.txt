 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020567: 
a(n) = 550*a(n - 3) - 215*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -215*a(n - 2) + 550*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 461

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
