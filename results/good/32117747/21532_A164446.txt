A164446: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 62, a(4) = 103, a(5) = 172, a(6) = 286

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
