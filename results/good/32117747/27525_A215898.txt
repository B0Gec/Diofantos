A215898: 
a(n) = -a(n - 12) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = -3, a(4) = 5, a(5) = -8, a(6) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
