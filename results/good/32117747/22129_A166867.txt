 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A166867: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 5*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
