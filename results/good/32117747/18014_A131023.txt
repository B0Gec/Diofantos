While total time consumed by now, scale:18015/34371, seq_id:A131023, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A131023: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
