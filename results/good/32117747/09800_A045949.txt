While total time consumed by now, scale:9801/34371, seq_id:A045949, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A045949: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 116, a(4) = 262

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
