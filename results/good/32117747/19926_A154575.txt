While total time consumed by now, scale:19927/34371, seq_id:A154575, order:20 took:
 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A154575: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 17) - a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 18, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 58

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
