A129006: 
a(n) = -1296*a(n - 4) + 864*a(n - 3) - 216*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -216*a(n - 2) + 864*a(n - 3) + -1296*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 432, a(2) = 7776, a(3) = 103680

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
