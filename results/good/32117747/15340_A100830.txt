 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A100830: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 10) + -1*a(n - 11),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 16, a(7) = 17, a(8) = 18, a(9) = 1, a(10) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
