While total time consumed by now, scale:31009/34371, seq_id:A276041, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A276041: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
