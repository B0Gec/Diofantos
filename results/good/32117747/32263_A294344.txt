While total time consumed by now, scale:32264/34371, seq_id:A294344, order:20 took:
 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A294344: 
a(n) = 100*a(n - 7) - 20*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 100*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -120*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 79

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
