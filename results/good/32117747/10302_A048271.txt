A048271: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
