 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A180343: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = -4, a(1) = -2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -4, a(4) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
