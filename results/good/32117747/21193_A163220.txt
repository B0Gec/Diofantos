 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163220: 
a(n) = -630*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 3) + 35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + 35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + -630*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 1332, a(3) = 47952

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
