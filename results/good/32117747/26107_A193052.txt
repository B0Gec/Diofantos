 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A193052: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 60*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
