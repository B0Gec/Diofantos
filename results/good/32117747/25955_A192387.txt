While total time consumed by now, scale:25956/34371, seq_id:A192387, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192387: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 12*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
