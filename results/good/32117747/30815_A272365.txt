 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A272365: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 34, a(2) = 250

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
