 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A288795: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 41, a(2) = 143

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
