 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163221: 
a(n) = -666*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) + 36*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + 36*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3) + -666*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 38, a(2) = 1406, a(3) = 52022

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
