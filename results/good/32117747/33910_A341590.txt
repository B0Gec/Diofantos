 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A341590: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) - 20*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
