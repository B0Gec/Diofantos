While total time consumed by now, scale:7102/34371, seq_id:A037757, order:20 took:
 5.4 seconds, i.e. 0.09 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A037757: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 10*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 10*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 231, a(3) = 2310

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
