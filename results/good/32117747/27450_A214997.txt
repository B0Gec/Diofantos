While total time consumed by now, scale:27451/34371, seq_id:A214997, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A214997: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
