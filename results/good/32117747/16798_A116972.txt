While total time consumed by now, scale:16799/34371, seq_id:A116972, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A116972: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 3*a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 85

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
