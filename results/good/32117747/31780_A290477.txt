A290477: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -6*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 118, a(3) = 709, a(4) = 4259, a(5) = 25557

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
