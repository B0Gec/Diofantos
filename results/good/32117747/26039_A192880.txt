While total time consumed by now, scale:26040/34371, seq_id:A192880, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192880: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
