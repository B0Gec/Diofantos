 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A141221: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + 8*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) - 5*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 156, a(3) = 826

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
