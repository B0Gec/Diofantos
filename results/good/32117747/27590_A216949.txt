 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A216949: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 10*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
