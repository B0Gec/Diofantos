 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A227959: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
