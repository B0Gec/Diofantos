While total time consumed by now, scale:15082/34371, seq_id:A099432, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A099432: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -18*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 162

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
