While total time consumed by now, scale:3182/34371, seq_id:A016280, order:20 took:
 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016280: 
a(n) = 66*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 46*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -61*a(n - 2) + 66*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 195

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
