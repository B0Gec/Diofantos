A093509: 
a(n) = -a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 12, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 18, a(7) = 20, a(8) = 24, a(9) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
