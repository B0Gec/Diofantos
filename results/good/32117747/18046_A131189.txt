 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A131189: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 23, a(4) = 30, a(5) = 37, a(6) = 51

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
