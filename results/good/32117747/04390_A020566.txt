 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020566: 
a(n) = 540*a(n - 3) - 213*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -213*a(n - 2) + 540*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 463

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
