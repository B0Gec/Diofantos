While total time consumed by now, scale:26076/34371, seq_id:A192962, order:20 took:
 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A192962: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
