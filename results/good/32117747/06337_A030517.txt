While total time consumed by now, scale:6338/34371, seq_id:A030517, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A030517: 
a(n) = -25*a(n - 8) + 5*a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 25*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 52

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
