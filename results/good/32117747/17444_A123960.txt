While total time consumed by now, scale:17445/34371, seq_id:A123960, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A123960: 
a(n) = -49*a(n - 7) - 18*a(n - 6) + 17*a(n - 5) + 32*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 25*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3) + -49*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
