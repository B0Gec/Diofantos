 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A199579: 
a(n) = -24*a(n - 5) + 72*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 3) - 56*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -72*a(n - 2) + 96*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 232

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
