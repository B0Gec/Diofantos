 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A046180: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 37634*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 37634*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37635*a(n - 1) + -37635*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 40755, a(2) = 1533776805

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
