 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A290157: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 151646890045, a(1) = 836564809606, a(2) = 942785024683

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
