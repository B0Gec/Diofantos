 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A289788: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 5*a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 156

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
