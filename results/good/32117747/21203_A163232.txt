 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163232: 
a(n) = -990*a(n - 4) + 44*a(n - 3) + 44*a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 1) + 44*a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 3) + -990*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 46, a(2) = 2070, a(3) = 93150

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
