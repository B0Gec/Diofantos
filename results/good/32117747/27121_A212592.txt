 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A212592: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 10) - 28*a(n - 8) - 7*a(n - 6) - 15*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 21*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 106, a(4) = 201, a(5) = 2022

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
