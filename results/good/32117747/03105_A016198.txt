While total time consumed by now, scale:3106/34371, seq_id:A016198, order:20 took:
 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016198: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 47

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
