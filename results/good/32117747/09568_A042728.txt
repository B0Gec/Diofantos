A042728: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 598*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 598*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 29, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 269, a(3) = 299, a(4) = 17611, a(5) = 17910, a(6) = 160891, a(7) = 178801

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
