 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A105036: 
a(n) = a(n - 19) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 26*a(n - 2) + -26*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 116, a(4) = 220

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
