 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016317: 
a(n) = 160*a(n - 4) + 44*a(n - 3) - 96*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -116*a(n - 2) + 160*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 284

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
