While total time consumed by now, scale:513/34371, seq_id:A003731, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A003731: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 30

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
