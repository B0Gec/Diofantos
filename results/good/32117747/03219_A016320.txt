 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016320: 
a(n) = 192*a(n - 3) - 136*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -136*a(n - 2) + 192*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 348

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
