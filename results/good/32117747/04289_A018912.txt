 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A018912: 
a(n) = 200*a(n - 3) - 110*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -110*a(n - 2) + 200*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 251

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
