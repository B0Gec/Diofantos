 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A179596: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 6) - 5*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
