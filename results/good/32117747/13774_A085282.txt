While total time consumed by now, scale:13775/34371, seq_id:A085282, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A085282: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 19) - 7*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
