 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A141385: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 31

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
