 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A136782: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 3) - 43*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -43*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3) + 27*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 119

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
