While total time consumed by now, scale:15800/34371, seq_id:A106541, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A106541: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
