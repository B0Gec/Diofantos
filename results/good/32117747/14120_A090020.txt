 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A090020: 
a(n) = -30*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 21*a(n - 5) + 21*a(n - 4) - 21*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -41*a(n - 2) + 61*a(n - 3) + -30*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 91

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
