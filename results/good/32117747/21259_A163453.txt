 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163453: 
a(n) = -153*a(n - 5) + 17*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 3) + 17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + 17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + 17*a(n - 4) + -153*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 342, a(3) = 6156, a(4) = 110808

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
