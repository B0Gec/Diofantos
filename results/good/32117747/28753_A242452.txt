While total time consumed by now, scale:28754/34371, seq_id:A242452, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A242452: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 54

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
