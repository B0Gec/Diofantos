A296796: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 63, a(4) = 72, a(5) = 132

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
