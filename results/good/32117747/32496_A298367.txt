A298367: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 14*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 42

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
