 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020569: 
a(n) = 660*a(n - 3) - 247*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -247*a(n - 2) + 660*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 537

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
