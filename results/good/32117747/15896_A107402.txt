 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A107402: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - 5*a(n - 10) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
