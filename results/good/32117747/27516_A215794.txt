 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A215794: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 4) - 28*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = -31, a(2) = -609

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
