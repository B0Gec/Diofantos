A063813: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 11*a(n - 6) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 132, a(3) = 1452, a(4) = 15972, a(5) = 175692

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
