A062544: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) - 2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
