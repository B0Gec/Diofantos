 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A019613: 
a(n) = 252*a(n - 3) - 127*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -127*a(n - 2) + 252*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 273

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
