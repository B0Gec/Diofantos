While total time consumed by now, scale:121/34371, seq_id:A000963, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A000963: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
