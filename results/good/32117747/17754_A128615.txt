While total time consumed by now, scale:17755/34371, seq_id:A128615, order:20 took:
 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A128615: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
