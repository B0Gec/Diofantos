 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A048474: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 19) - 3*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
