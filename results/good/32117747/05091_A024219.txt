While total time consumed by now, scale:5092/34371, seq_id:A024219, order:20 took:
 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A024219: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
