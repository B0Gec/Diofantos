A140992: 
a(n) = a(n - 11) + 2*a(n - 10) - 3*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
