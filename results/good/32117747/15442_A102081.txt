While total time consumed by now, scale:15443/34371, seq_id:A102081, order:20 took:
 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A102081: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
