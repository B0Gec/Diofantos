While total time consumed by now, scale:13550/34371, seq_id:A083321, order:20 took:
 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A083321: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
