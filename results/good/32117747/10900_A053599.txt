While total time consumed by now, scale:10901/34371, seq_id:A053599, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A053599: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 18) - 2*a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
