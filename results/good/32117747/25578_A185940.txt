While total time consumed by now, scale:25579/34371, seq_id:A185940, order:20 took:
 3.7 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A185940: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 4*a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 24, a(1) = 74, a(2) = 228

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
