 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A107736: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 1331714*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 1331714*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1331715*a(n - 1) + -1331715*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 35, a(1) = 46651605, a(2) = 62126595542551

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
