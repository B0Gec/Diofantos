 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A260033: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 71

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
