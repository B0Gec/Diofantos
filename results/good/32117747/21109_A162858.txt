 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A162858: 
a(n) = -666*a(n - 3) + 36*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + 36*a(n - 2) + -666*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 38, a(2) = 1406

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
