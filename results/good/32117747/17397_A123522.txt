While total time consumed by now, scale:17398/34371, seq_id:A123522, order:20 took:
 4.7 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A123522: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 10*a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) - 10*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
