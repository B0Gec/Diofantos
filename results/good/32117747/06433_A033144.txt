 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A033144: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 64, a(3) = 513

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
