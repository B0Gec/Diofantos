 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074580: 
a(n) = 504*a(n - 3) - 191*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -191*a(n - 2) + 504*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 194

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
