A040842: 
a(n) = a(n - 20)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 29, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 13, a(6) = 1, a(7) = 7, a(8) = 1, a(9) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
