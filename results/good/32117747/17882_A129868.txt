While total time consumed by now, scale:17883/34371, seq_id:A129868, order:20 took:
 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A129868: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
