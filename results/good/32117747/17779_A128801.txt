 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A128801: 
a(n) = 343*a(n - 3) - 147*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -147*a(n - 2) + 343*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 98, a(2) = 2058

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
