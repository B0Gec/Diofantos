 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A083322: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
