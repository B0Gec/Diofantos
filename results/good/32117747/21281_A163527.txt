 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163527: 
a(n) = -325*a(n - 5) + 25*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 3) + 25*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + 25*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + 25*a(n - 4) + -325*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 702, a(3) = 18252, a(4) = 474552

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
