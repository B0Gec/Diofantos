 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A174988: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 8) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
