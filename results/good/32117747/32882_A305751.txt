A305751: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 8) - 7*a(n - 6) - 9*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + -7*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
