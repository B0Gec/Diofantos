 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A153237: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
