 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014927: 
a(n) = 144*a(n - 4) - 24*a(n - 3) - 143*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -168*a(n - 2) + 144*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 457

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
