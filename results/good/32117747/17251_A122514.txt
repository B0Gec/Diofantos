While total time consumed by now, scale:17252/34371, seq_id:A122514, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A122514: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
