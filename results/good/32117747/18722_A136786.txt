 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A136786: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) + 16*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
