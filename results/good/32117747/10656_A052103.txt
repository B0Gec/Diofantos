While total time consumed by now, scale:10657/34371, seq_id:A052103, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A052103: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 13) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
