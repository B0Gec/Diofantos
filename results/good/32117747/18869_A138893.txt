A138893: 
a(n) = -a(n - 12) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 47

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
