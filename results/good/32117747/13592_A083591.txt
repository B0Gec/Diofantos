 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A083591: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
