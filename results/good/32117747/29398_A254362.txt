While total time consumed by now, scale:29399/34371, seq_id:A254362, order:20 took:
 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A254362: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
