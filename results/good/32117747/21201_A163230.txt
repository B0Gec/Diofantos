 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163230: 
a(n) = -903*a(n - 4) + 42*a(n - 3) + 42*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + 42*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 3) + -903*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 44, a(2) = 1892, a(3) = 81356

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
