While total time consumed by now, scale:3206/34371, seq_id:A016306, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A016306: 
a(n) = 108*a(n - 5) + 24*a(n - 4) + 41*a(n - 3) - 68*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 108*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 205

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
