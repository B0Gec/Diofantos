While total time consumed by now, scale:16223/34371, seq_id:A110310, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A110310: 
a(n) = a(n - 11) + 5*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 2) - 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -7, a(2) = 36, a(3) = -173

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
