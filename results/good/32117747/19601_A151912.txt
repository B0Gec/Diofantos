 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A151912: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -4, a(2) = -28, a(3) = -56

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
