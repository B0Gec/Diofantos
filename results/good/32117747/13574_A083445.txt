While total time consumed by now, scale:13575/34371, seq_id:A083445, order:20 took:
 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A083445: 
a(n) = 90*a(n - 7) - 19*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 90*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -109*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 18, a(1) = 270, a(2) = 3438

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
