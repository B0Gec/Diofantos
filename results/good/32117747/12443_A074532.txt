 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A074532: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 27*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -38*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
