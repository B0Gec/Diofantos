 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A322458: 
a(n) = -49*a(n - 6) - a(n - 3) + 48*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 49*a(n - 2) + -49*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 98

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
