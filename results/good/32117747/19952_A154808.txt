 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A154808: 
a(n) = -32*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -32*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 31, a(1) = 992, a(2) = 31775

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
