 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A106528: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 56, a(4) = 126, a(5) = 204

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
