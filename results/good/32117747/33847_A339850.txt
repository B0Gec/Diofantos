 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A339850: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
