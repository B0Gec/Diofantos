 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A162740: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
