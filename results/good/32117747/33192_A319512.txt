 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A319512: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
