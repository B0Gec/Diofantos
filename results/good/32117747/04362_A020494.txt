 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020494: 
a(n) = 450*a(n - 3) - 185*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -185*a(n - 2) + 450*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 391

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
