 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A079973: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
