While total time consumed by now, scale:30851/34371, seq_id:A273308, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A273308: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
