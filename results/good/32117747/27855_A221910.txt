While total time consumed by now, scale:27856/34371, seq_id:A221910, order:20 took:
 4.1 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A221910: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - 8*a(n - 12) + a(n - 11) - 8*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 80

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
