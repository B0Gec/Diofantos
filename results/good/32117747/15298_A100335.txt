 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A100335: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
