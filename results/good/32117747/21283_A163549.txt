A163549: 
a(n) = -378*a(n - 5) + 27*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) + 27*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + 27*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + 27*a(n - 4) + -378*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 812, a(3) = 22736, a(4) = 636608

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
