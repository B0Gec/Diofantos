 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A018069: 
a(n) = 240*a(n - 3) - 134*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -134*a(n - 2) + 240*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 307

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
