While total time consumed by now, scale:11620/34371, seq_id:A061703, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A061703: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
