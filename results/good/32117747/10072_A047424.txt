A047424: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
