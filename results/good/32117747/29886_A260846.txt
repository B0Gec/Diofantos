While total time consumed by now, scale:29887/34371, seq_id:A260846, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A260846: 
a(n) = 45*a(n - 11) - 18*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 45*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 770

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
