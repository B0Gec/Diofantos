While total time consumed by now, scale:33443/34371, seq_id:A328353, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A328353: 
a(n) = 360*a(n - 7) - 66*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 360*a(n - 2) + 66*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 67*a(n - 1) + -426*a(n - 2) + 360*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 67

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
