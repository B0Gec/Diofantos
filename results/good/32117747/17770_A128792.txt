 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A128792: 
a(n) = -1296*a(n - 5) - 432*a(n - 4) + 648*a(n - 3) - 192*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -216*a(n - 2) + 864*a(n - 3) + -1296*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 288, a(3) = 5832

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
