 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A128797: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
