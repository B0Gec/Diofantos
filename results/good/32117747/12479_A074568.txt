 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074568: 
a(n) = 224*a(n - 3) - 116*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -116*a(n - 2) + 224*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 129

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
