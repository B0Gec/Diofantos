While total time consumed by now, scale:22305/34371, seq_id:A167592, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A167592: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -2, a(1) = -8, a(2) = -16, a(3) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
