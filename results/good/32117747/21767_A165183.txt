A165183: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 48, a(6) = 96, a(7) = 192

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
