While total time consumed by now, scale:4483/34371, seq_id:A021008, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A021008: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 52

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
