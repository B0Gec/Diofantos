A203161: 
a(n) = -36*a(n - 6) + 12*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -36*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 39, a(4) = 57, a(5) = 132

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
