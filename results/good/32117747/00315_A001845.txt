While total time consumed by now, scale:316/34371, seq_id:A001845, order:20 took:
 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A001845: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 63

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
