While total time consumed by now, scale:253/34371, seq_id:A001590, order:20 took:
 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A001590: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
