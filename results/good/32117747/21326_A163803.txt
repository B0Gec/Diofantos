 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163803: 
a(n) = -1035*a(n - 5) + 45*a(n - 4) + 45*a(n - 3) + 45*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 45*a(n - 1) + 45*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3) + 45*a(n - 4) + -1035*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 47, a(2) = 2162, a(3) = 99452, a(4) = 4574792

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
