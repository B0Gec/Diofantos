 66.4 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A019992: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 88, a(3) = 368, a(4) = 1538

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
