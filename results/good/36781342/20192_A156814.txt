While total time consumed by now, scale:20193/34371, seq_id:A156814, order:20 took:
 71.3 seconds, i.e. 1.19 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A156814: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 17) - a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 226, a(1) = 902, a(2) = 2028

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
