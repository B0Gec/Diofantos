While total time consumed by now, scale:18344/34371, seq_id:A133405, order:20 took:
 54.2 seconds, i.e. 0.9 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A133405: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
