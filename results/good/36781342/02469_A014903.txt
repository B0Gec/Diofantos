 76.7 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A014903: 
a(n) = 2*n + 19*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 402

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
