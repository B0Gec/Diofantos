While total time consumed by now, scale:18463/34371, seq_id:A134311, order:20 took:
 64.4 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A134311: 
a(n) = -n + 4*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
