 42.3 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A014610: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 19

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
