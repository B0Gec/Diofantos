While total time consumed by now, scale:19443/34371, seq_id:A145840, order:20 took:
 62.9 seconds, i.e. 1.05 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A145840: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 164

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
