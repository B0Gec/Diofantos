While total time consumed by now, scale:17421/34371, seq_id:A123879, order:20 took:
 55.9 seconds, i.e. 0.93 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A123879: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
