 57.3 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A296909: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 39

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
