While total time consumed by now, scale:15995/34371, seq_id:A108195, order:20 took:
 97.9 seconds, i.e. 1.63 minutes or 0.027 hours.

A108195: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
