 41.7 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A086093: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 29*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 48*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
