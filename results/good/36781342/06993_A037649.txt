 51.6 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A037649: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 148, a(3) = 1039

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
