While total time consumed by now, scale:3119/34371, seq_id:A016212, order:20 took:
 57.9 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A016212: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 17) - 10*a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) - 21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 90

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
