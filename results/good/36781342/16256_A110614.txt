 52.2 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A110614: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
