 71.4 seconds, i.e. 1.19 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A164475: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 44, a(4) = 63

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
