A218348: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 41, a(3) = 149, a(4) = 547

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
