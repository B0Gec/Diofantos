While total time consumed by now, scale:12449/34371, seq_id:A074537, order:20 took:
 78.1 seconds, i.e. 1.3 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A074537: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 40*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -52*a(n - 2) + 60*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 65

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
