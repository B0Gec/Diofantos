 84.5 seconds, i.e. 1.41 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A144929: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 110*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -111*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 166, a(2) = 18313

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
