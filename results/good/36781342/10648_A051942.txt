While total time consumed by now, scale:10649/34371, seq_id:A051942, order:20 took:
 88.2 seconds, i.e. 1.47 minutes or 0.025 hours.

A051942: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 13) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
