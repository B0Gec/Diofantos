While total time consumed by now, scale:32381/34371, seq_id:A295858, order:20 took:
 63.1 seconds, i.e. 1.05 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A295858: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -2, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
