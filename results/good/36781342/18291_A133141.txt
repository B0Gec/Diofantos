 116.7 seconds, i.e. 1.94 minutes or 0.032 hours.

A133141: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 482*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 482*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 483*a(n - 1) + -483*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 331, a(2) = 159391

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
