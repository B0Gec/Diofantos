While total time consumed by now, scale:27659/34371, seq_id:A218458, order:20 took:
 66.1 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A218458: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -11927, a(1) = -9311, a(2) = -7009, a(3) = -5009

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
