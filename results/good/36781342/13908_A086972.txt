 58.3 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A086972: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
