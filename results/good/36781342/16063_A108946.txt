 56.8 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A108946: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -3, a(2) = 13, a(3) = -48

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
