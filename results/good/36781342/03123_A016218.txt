While total time consumed by now, scale:3124/34371, seq_id:A016218, order:20 took:
 53.1 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A016218: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 10) - 9*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 20*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 71

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
