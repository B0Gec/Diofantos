While total time consumed by now, scale:16711/34371, seq_id:A116772, order:20 took:
 70.8 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A116772: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) - 9*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + -13*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
