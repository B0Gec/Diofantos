A291411: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 63, a(4) = 189, a(5) = 567

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
