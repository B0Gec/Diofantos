While total time consumed by now, scale:19990/34371, seq_id:A155136, order:20 took:
 65.5 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A155136: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 13) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -28, a(1) = -27, a(2) = -24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
