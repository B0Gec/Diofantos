While total time consumed by now, scale:15418/34371, seq_id:A101859, order:20 took:
 82.6 seconds, i.e. 1.38 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A101859: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
