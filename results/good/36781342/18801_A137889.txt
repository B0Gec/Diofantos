While total time consumed by now, scale:18802/34371, seq_id:A137889, order:20 took:
 63.8 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A137889: 
a(n) = -192*a(n - 5) + 124*a(n - 4) + 169*a(n - 3) - 123*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -147*a(n - 2) + 316*a(n - 3) + -192*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 384, a(3) = 5460

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
