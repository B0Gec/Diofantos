While total time consumed by now, scale:17080/34371, seq_id:A120691, order:20 took:
 58.3 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A120691: 
a(n) = a(n - 19) + a(n - 17) + a(n - 15) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -1, a(4) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
