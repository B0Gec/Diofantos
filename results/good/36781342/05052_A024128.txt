While total time consumed by now, scale:5053/34371, seq_id:A024128, order:20 took:
 64.2 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A024128: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 11*a(n - 9) - 10*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 119

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
