 62.9 seconds, i.e. 1.05 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A107389: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 5*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
