While total time consumed by now, scale:19033/34371, seq_id:A140420, order:20 took:
 47.4 seconds, i.e. 0.79 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A140420: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
