While total time consumed by now, scale:6875/34371, seq_id:A037530, order:20 took:
 36.8 seconds, i.e. 0.61 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A037530: 
a(n) = n + 2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 161

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
