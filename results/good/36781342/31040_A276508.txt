 55.5 seconds, i.e. 0.93 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A276508: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + 5*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
