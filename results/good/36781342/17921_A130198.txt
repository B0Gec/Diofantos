 83.1 seconds, i.e. 1.39 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A130198: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
