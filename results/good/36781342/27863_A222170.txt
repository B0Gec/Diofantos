While total time consumed by now, scale:27864/34371, seq_id:A222170, order:20 took:
 64.1 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A222170: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 26

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
