While total time consumed by now, scale:12704/34371, seq_id:A077802, order:20 took:
 111.3 seconds, i.e. 1.86 minutes or 0.031 hours.

A077802: 
a(n) = 2*n - 2*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) + 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
