While total time consumed by now, scale:11462/34371, seq_id:A060157, order:20 took:
 72.2 seconds, i.e. 1.2 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A060157: 
a(n) = -2*n + 6*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 58, a(3) = 236

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
