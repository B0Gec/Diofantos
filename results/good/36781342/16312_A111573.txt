 37.1 seconds, i.e. 0.62 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A111573: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
