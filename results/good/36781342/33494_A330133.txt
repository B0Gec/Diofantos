While total time consumed by now, scale:33495/34371, seq_id:A330133, order:20 took:
 61.7 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A330133: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
