 67.8 seconds, i.e. 1.13 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A074511: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 6) - 9*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 20*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 42

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
