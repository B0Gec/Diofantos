While total time consumed by now, scale:16178/34371, seq_id:A109961, order:20 took:
 41.4 seconds, i.e. 0.69 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A109961: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
