 42.0 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A109544: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
