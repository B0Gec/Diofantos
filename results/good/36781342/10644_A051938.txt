While total time consumed by now, scale:10645/34371, seq_id:A051938, order:20 took:
 96.2 seconds, i.e. 1.6 minutes or 0.027 hours.

A051938: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
