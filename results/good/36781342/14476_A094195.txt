While total time consumed by now, scale:14477/34371, seq_id:A094195, order:20 took:
 109.0 seconds, i.e. 1.82 minutes or 0.03 hours.

A094195: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) - 5*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 5*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
