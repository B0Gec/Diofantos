 39.4 seconds, i.e. 0.66 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A100216: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
