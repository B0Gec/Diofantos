 56.9 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A055998: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
