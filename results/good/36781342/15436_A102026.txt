 53.1 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A102026: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 25

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
