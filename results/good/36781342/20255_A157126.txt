A157126: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -3, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 11

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
