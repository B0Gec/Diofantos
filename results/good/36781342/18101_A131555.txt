 30.3 seconds, i.e. 0.51 minutes or 0.008 hours.

A131555: 
a(n) = a(n - 18)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
