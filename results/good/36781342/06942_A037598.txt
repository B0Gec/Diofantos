 39.6 seconds, i.e. 0.66 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A037598: 
a(n) = -3*n - 2*a(n - 20) + 2*a(n - 19) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 201

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
