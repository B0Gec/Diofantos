 50.1 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A163315: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 36, a(4) = 108

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
