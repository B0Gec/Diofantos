 67.0 seconds, i.e. 1.12 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A239577: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) +  -6*a(n - 2) +  12*a(n - 3) +  -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
