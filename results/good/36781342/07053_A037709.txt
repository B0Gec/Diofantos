 35.0 seconds, i.e. 0.58 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A037709: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 120

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
