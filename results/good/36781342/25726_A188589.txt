While total time consumed by now, scale:25727/34371, seq_id:A188589, order:20 took:
 102.2 seconds, i.e. 1.7 minutes or 0.028 hours.

A188589: 
a(n) = 2*n - 2*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) + 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
