 42.0 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A037751: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 45, a(3) = 180

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
