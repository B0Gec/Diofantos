 59.1 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A143975: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 13) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
