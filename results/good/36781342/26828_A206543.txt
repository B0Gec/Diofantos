 47.8 seconds, i.e. 0.8 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A206543: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
