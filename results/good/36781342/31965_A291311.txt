 82.2 seconds, i.e. 1.37 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A291311: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 16

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
