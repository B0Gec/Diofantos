While total time consumed by now, scale:19150/34371, seq_id:A141752, order:20 took:
 43.2 seconds, i.e. 0.72 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A141752: 
a(n) = n + a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
