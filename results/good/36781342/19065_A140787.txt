 50.4 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A140787: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 9

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
