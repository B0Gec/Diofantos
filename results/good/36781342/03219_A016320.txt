 70.2 seconds, i.e. 1.17 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A016320: 
a(n) = 192*a(n - 4) + 56*a(n - 3) - 114*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -136*a(n - 2) + 192*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 348

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
