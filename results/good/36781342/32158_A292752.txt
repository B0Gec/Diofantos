 62.6 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A292752: 
a(n) = 45*a(n - 8) - 14*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 45*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -59*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
