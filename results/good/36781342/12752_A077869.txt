 42.7 seconds, i.e. 0.71 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A077869: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
