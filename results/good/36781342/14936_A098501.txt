While total time consumed by now, scale:14937/34371, seq_id:A098501, order:20 took:
 59.7 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A098501: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
