 86.4 seconds, i.e. 1.44 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A287057: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
