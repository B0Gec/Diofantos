While total time consumed by now, scale:17896/34371, seq_id:A129959, order:20 took:
 57.6 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A129959: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 59

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
