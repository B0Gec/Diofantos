While total time consumed by now, scale:25618/34371, seq_id:A186947, order:20 took:
 51.7 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A186947: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
