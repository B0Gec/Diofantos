 62.1 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A337753: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 17) - a(n - 16) - 5*a(n - 12) + a(n - 11) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
