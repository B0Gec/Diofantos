 35.5 seconds, i.e. 0.59 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A279285: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 18

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
