 44.4 seconds, i.e. 0.74 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A140282: 
a(n) = -a(n - 14) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
