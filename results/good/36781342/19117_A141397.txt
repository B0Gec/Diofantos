While total time consumed by now, scale:19118/34371, seq_id:A141397, order:20 took:
 53.1 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A141397: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - 3*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 62

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
