While total time consumed by now, scale:17470/34371, seq_id:A124280, order:20 took:
 65.8 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A124280: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
