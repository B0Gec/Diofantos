While total time consumed by now, scale:17356/34371, seq_id:A123169, order:20 took:
 56.5 seconds, i.e. 0.94 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A123169: 
a(n) = -a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
