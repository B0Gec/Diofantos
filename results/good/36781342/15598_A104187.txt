A104187: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) - 2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
