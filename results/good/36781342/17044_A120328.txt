While total time consumed by now, scale:17045/34371, seq_id:A120328, order:20 took:
 61.8 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A120328: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
