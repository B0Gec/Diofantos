While total time consumed by now, scale:31802/34371, seq_id:A290721, order:20 took:
 66.3 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A290721: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 60

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
