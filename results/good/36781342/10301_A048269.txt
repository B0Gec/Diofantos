 50.9 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A048269: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 154, a(5) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
