While total time consumed by now, scale:25953/34371, seq_id:A192377, order:20 took:
 73.2 seconds, i.e. 1.22 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A192377: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 8) - 3*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
