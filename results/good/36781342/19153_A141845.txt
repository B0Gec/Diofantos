While total time consumed by now, scale:19154/34371, seq_id:A141845, order:20 took:
 37.5 seconds, i.e. 0.63 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A141845: 
a(n) = -2*n - a(n - 20) + 2*a(n - 19) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 194, a(4) = 976, a(5) = 4887

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
