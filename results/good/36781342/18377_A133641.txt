 92.1 seconds, i.e. 1.54 minutes or 0.026 hours.

A133641: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) - 2*a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
