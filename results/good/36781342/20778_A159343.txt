 51.1 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A159343: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 39

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
