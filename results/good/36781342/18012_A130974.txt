 57.5 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A130974: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
