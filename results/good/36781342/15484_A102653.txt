 60.1 seconds, i.e. 1.0 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A102653: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 56

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
