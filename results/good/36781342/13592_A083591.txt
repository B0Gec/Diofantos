 66.7 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A083591: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
