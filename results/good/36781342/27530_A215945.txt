While total time consumed by now, scale:27531/34371, seq_id:A215945, order:20 took:
 64.1 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A215945: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 5) - 24*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 33*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -3, a(1) = -105, a(2) = -3387

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
