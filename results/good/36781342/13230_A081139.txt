 60.5 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A081139: 
a(n) = 729*a(n - 3) - 243*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -243*a(n - 2) + 729*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
