While total time consumed by now, scale:27077/34371, seq_id:A212427, order:20 took:
 52.6 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A212427: 
a(n) = a(n - 14) - a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
