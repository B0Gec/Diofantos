While total time consumed by now, scale:34333/34371, seq_id:A355509, order:20 took:
 54.4 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A355509: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
