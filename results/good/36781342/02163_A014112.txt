While total time consumed by now, scale:2164/34371, seq_id:A014112, order:20 took:
 57.2 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A014112: 
a(n) = -a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
