 81.1 seconds, i.e. 1.35 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A184550: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
