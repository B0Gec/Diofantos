While total time consumed by now, scale:33444/34371, seq_id:A328354, order:20 took:
 66.4 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A328354: 
a(n) = 490*a(n - 7) - 77*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 490*a(n - 2) + 77*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 78*a(n - 1) + -567*a(n - 2) + 490*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 78

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
