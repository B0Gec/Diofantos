While total time consumed by now, scale:15163/34371, seq_id:A099754, order:20 took:
 60.8 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A099754: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
