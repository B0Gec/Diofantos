 108.7 seconds, i.e. 1.81 minutes or 0.03 hours.

A210678: 
a(n) = n + a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
