 63.8 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A133044: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 11, a(5) = 20

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
