 52.8 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A178748: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 11) - 3*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
