While total time consumed by now, scale:18244/34371, seq_id:A132753, order:20 took:
 102.5 seconds, i.e. 1.71 minutes or 0.028 hours.

A132753: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - 2*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
