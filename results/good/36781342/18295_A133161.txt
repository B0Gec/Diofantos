While total time consumed by now, scale:18296/34371, seq_id:A133161, order:20 took:
 60.1 seconds, i.e. 1.0 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A133161: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
