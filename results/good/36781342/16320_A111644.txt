 51.7 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A111644: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -6, a(2) = 29, a(3) = -124

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
