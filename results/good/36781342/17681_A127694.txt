While total time consumed by now, scale:17682/34371, seq_id:A127694, order:20 took:
 58.5 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A127694: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 580, a(1) = 1175, a(2) = 2070, a(3) = 3325

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
