 68.1 seconds, i.e. 1.13 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A156857: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -9, a(3) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
