While total time consumed by now, scale:25999/34371, seq_id:A192803, order:20 took:
 44.7 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A192803: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
