 54.2 seconds, i.e. 0.9 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A047447: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
