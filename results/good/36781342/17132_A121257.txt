While total time consumed by now, scale:17133/34371, seq_id:A121257, order:20 took:
 36.6 seconds, i.e. 0.61 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A121257: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 76, a(3) = 260

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
