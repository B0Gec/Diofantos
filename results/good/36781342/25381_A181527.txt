While total time consumed by now, scale:25382/34371, seq_id:A181527, order:20 took:
 64.6 seconds, i.e. 1.08 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A181527: 
a(n) = 3*n + 4*a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
