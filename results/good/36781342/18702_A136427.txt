 42.4 seconds, i.e. 0.71 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A136427: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
