 62.1 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A111734: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
