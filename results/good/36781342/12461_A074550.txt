 71.1 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A074550: 
a(n) = 96*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) - 53*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -68*a(n - 2) + 96*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 89

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
