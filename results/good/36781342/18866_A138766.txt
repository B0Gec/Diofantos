 37.3 seconds, i.e. 0.62 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A138766: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
