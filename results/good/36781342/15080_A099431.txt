 50.4 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A099431: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 20) + 3*a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
