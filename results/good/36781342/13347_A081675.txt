While total time consumed by now, scale:13348/34371, seq_id:A081675, order:20 took:
 68.9 seconds, i.e. 1.15 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A081675: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 28*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -38*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
