While total time consumed by now, scale:17389/34371, seq_id:A123363, order:20 took:
 59.3 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A123363: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 63

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
