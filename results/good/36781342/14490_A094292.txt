 49.8 seconds, i.e. 0.83 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A094292: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
