 67.0 seconds, i.e. 1.12 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A112553: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
