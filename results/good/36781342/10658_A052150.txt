 47.1 seconds, i.e. 0.78 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A052150: 
a(n) = 3*n - 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 82

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
