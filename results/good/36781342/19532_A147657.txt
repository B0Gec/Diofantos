 51.9 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A147657: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + a(n - 16) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
