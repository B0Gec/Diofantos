 52.8 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A132357: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
