 57.5 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A274129: 
a(n) = 242*a(n - 4) + 77*a(n - 3) - 141*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -165*a(n - 2) + 242*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 253, a(2) = 4257

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
