 60.3 seconds, i.e. 1.0 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A305002: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 51, a(3) = 101, a(4) = 107

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
