While total time consumed by now, scale:20018/34371, seq_id:A155593, order:20 took:
 54.4 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A155593: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 15) - 11*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) - 18*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 84

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
