 64.8 seconds, i.e. 1.08 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A019496: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 81

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
