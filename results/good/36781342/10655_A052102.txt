 44.1 seconds, i.e. 0.73 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A052102: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 13) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
