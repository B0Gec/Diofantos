 51.3 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A293143: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 7) - 11*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 24*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 96

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
