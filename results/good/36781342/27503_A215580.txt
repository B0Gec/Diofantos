 59.0 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A215580: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
