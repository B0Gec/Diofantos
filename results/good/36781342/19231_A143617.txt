 63.8 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A143617: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 15) + a(n - 8) + 10*a(n - 7)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 10*a(n - 7) + -10*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 28, a(6) = 68, a(7) = 88

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
