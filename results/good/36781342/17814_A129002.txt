While total time consumed by now, scale:17815/34371, seq_id:A129002, order:20 took:
 47.1 seconds, i.e. 0.79 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A129002: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 288, a(3) = 1280

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
