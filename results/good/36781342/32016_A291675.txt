 61.5 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A291675: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2017, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
