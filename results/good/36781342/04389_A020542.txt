 76.6 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A020542: 
a(n) = 512*a(n - 3) - 336*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -336*a(n - 2) + 512*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 780, a(2) = 30744

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
