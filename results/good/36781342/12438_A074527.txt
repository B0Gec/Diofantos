 76.0 seconds, i.e. 1.27 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A074527: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
