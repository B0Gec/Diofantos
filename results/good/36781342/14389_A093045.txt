While total time consumed by now, scale:14390/34371, seq_id:A093045, order:20 took:
 57.2 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A093045: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
