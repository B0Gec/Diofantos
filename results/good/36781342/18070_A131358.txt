While total time consumed by now, scale:18071/34371, seq_id:A131358, order:20 took:
 59.4 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A131358: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
