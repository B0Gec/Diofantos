 57.8 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A163432: 
a(n) = -55*a(n - 5) + 10*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4) + -55*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 132, a(3) = 1452, a(4) = 15972

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
