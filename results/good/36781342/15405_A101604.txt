 60.5 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A101604: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
