A099494: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = -1, a(5) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
