 56.8 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A049602: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
