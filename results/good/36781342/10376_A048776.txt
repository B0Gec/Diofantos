 51.2 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A048776: 
a(n) = 2*n + a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
