 39.4 seconds, i.e. 0.66 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A131720: 
a(n) = a(n - 18)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = -1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
