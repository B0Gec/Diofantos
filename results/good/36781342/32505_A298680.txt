While total time consumed by now, scale:32506/34371, seq_id:A298680, order:20 took:
 62.3 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A298680: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 9) - 7*a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -9*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
