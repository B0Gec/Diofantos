While total time consumed by now, scale:17675/34371, seq_id:A127617, order:20 took:
 51.9 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A127617: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
