 42.3 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A276600: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 20

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
