While total time consumed by now, scale:19796/34371, seq_id:A153466, order:20 took:
 71.8 seconds, i.e. 1.2 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A153466: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 232, a(1) = 610, a(2) = 1600

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
