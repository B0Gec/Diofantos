 108.4 seconds, i.e. 1.81 minutes or 0.03 hours.

A216606: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
