 68.2 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A338186: 
a(n) = -2*n + 4*a(n - 20) + 6*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 126

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
