 71.9 seconds, i.e. 1.2 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A254365: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 4*a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 15, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
