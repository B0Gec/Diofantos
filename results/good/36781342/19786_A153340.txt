 65.4 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A153340: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 48

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
