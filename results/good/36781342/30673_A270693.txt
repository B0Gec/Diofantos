 57.8 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A270693: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 13) + a(n - 11) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -25, a(2) = 51, a(3) = -100

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
