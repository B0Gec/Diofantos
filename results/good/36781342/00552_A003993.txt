While total time consumed by now, scale:553/34371, seq_id:A003993, order:20 took:
 78.4 seconds, i.e. 1.31 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A003993: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 3*a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 46

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
