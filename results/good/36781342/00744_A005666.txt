 38.2 seconds, i.e. 0.64 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A005666: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
