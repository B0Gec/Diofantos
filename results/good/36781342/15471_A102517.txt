 62.3 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A102517: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 11) - a(n - 9) - 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
