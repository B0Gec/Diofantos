 83.2 seconds, i.e. 1.39 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A014929: 
a(n) = 196*a(n - 4) - 28*a(n - 3) - 195*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -224*a(n - 2) + 196*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 617

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
