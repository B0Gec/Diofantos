While total time consumed by now, scale:107/34371, seq_id:A000773, order:20 took:
 50.6 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A000773: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
