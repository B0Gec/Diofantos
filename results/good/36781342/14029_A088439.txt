A088439: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
