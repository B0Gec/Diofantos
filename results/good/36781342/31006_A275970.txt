While total time consumed by now, scale:31007/34371, seq_id:A275970, order:20 took:
 66.9 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A275970: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - 2*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
