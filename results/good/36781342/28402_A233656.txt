While total time consumed by now, scale:28403/34371, seq_id:A233656, order:20 took:
 95.9 seconds, i.e. 1.6 minutes or 0.027 hours.

A233656: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - 3*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
