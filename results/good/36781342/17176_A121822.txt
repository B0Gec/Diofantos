While total time consumed by now, scale:17177/34371, seq_id:A121822, order:20 took:
 63.8 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A121822: 
a(n) = 225*a(n - 16) - 34*a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - 225*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -259*a(n - 2) + 225*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 65

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
