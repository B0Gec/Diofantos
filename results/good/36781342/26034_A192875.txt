While total time consumed by now, scale:26035/34371, seq_id:A192875, order:20 took:
 60.9 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A192875: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 7) - 6*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
