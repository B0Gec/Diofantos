While total time consumed by now, scale:25809/34371, seq_id:A190277, order:20 took:
 64.3 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A190277: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
