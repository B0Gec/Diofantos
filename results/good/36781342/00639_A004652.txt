While total time consumed by now, scale:640/34371, seq_id:A004652, order:20 took:
 70.1 seconds, i.e. 1.17 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A004652: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
