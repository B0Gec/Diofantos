While total time consumed by now, scale:835/34371, seq_id:A006105, order:20 took:
 54.6 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A006105: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) - 20*a(n - 3) - 63*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 357

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
