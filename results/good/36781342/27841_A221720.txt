While total time consumed by now, scale:27842/34371, seq_id:A221720, order:20 took:
 46.2 seconds, i.e. 0.77 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A221720: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
