 44.0 seconds, i.e. 0.73 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A289321: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 7) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2017, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
