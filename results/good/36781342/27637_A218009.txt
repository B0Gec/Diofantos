While total time consumed by now, scale:27638/34371, seq_id:A218009, order:20 took:
 63.4 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A218009: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
