 61.0 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A191007: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
