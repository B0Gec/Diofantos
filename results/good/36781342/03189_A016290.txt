While total time consumed by now, scale:3190/34371, seq_id:A016290, order:20 took:
 64.9 seconds, i.e. 1.08 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A016290: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 42*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 140

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
