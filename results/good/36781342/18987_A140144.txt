While total time consumed by now, scale:18988/34371, seq_id:A140144, order:20 took:
 62.0 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A140144: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
