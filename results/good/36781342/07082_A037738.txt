 34.0 seconds, i.e. 0.57 minutes or 0.009 hours.

A037738: 
a(n) = -n + 2*a(n - 20) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 58, a(3) = 290, a(4) = 1452

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
