While total time consumed by now, scale:15623/34371, seq_id:A104581, order:20 took:
 60.3 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A104581: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
