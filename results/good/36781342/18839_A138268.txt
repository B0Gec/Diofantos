 42.1 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A138268: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = -17, a(3) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
