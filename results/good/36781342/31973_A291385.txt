While total time consumed by now, scale:31974/34371, seq_id:A291385, order:20 took:
 49.5 seconds, i.e. 0.83 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A291385: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 47

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
