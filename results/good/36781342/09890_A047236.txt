 73.8 seconds, i.e. 1.23 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A047236: 
a(n) = -a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
