 52.0 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A187035: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -1, a(4) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
