A138287: 
a(n) = a(n - 20)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 6, a(6) = 4, a(7) = 8, a(8) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
