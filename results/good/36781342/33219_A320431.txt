While total time consumed by now, scale:33220/34371, seq_id:A320431, order:20 took:
 57.1 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A320431: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 71, a(5) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
