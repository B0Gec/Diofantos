While total time consumed by now, scale:34146/34371, seq_id:A349723, order:20 took:
 55.6 seconds, i.e. 0.93 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A349723: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
