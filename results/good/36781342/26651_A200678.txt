 48.8 seconds, i.e. 0.81 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A200678: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
