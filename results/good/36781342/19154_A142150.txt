While total time consumed by now, scale:19155/34371, seq_id:A142150, order:20 took:
 36.2 seconds, i.e. 0.6 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A142150: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
