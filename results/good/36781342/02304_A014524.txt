 59.1 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A014524: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 5*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 47

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
