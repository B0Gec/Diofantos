While total time consumed by now, scale:1249/34371, seq_id:A008750, order:20 took:
 58.9 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A008750: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 11) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
