While total time consumed by now, scale:31205/34371, seq_id:A279511, order:20 took:
 70.9 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A279511: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 55

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
