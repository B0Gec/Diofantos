While total time consumed by now, scale:27852/34371, seq_id:A221906, order:20 took:
 58.3 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A221906: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
