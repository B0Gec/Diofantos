While total time consumed by now, scale:33200/34371, seq_id:A319667, order:20 took:
 76.5 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A319667: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 7) - 110*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 22, a(1) = 1111, a(2) = 101101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
