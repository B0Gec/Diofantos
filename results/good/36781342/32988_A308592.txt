 70.8 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A308592: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
