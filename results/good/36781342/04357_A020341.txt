 63.5 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A020341: 
a(n) = 420*a(n - 3) - 179*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -179*a(n - 2) + 420*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 397

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
