While total time consumed by now, scale:3195/34371, seq_id:A016295, order:20 took:
 54.8 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A016295: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 40*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -52*a(n - 2) + 60*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 117

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
