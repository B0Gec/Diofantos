 43.4 seconds, i.e. 0.72 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A116738: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
