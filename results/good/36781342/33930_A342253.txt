While total time consumed by now, scale:33931/34371, seq_id:A342253, order:20 took:
 46.1 seconds, i.e. 0.77 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A342253: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 31

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
