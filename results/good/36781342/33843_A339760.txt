 53.3 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A339760: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 6) + 8*a(n - 5) - 10*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 208

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
