While total time consumed by now, scale:11639/34371, seq_id:A061982, order:20 took:
 71.0 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A061982: 
a(n) = 4*n + 3*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
