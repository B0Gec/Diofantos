While total time consumed by now, scale:14033/34371, seq_id:A088581, order:20 took:
 49.5 seconds, i.e. 0.83 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A088581: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
