While total time consumed by now, scale:2238/34371, seq_id:A014324, order:20 took:
 43.8 seconds, i.e. 0.73 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A014324: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) + 2*a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
