 40.2 seconds, i.e. 0.67 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A192802: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
