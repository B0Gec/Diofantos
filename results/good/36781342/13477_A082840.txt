 63.4 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A082840: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
