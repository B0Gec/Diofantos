 63.9 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A003600: 
a(n) = n - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
