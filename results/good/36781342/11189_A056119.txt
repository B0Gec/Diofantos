While total time consumed by now, scale:11190/34371, seq_id:A056119, order:20 took:
 80.9 seconds, i.e. 1.35 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A056119: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
