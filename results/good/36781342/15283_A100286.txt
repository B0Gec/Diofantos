 44.1 seconds, i.e. 0.74 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A100286: 
a(n) = a(n - 12)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
