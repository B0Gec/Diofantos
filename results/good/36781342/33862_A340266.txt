While total time consumed by now, scale:33863/34371, seq_id:A340266, order:20 took:
 65.4 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A340266: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
