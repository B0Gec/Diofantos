While total time consumed by now, scale:3147/34371, seq_id:A016243, order:20 took:
 63.9 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A016243: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 6) - 14*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 48*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -62*a(n - 2) + 48*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 163

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
