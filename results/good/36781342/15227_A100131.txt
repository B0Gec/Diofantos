While total time consumed by now, scale:15228/34371, seq_id:A100131, order:20 took:
 58.9 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A100131: 
a(n) = -n - a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) + 3*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
