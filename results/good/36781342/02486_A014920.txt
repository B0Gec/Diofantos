While total time consumed by now, scale:2487/34371, seq_id:A014920, order:20 took:
 58.8 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A014920: 
a(n) = 49*a(n - 20) - 14*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 49*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 49*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 162

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
