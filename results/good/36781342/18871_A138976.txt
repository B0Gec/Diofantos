 50.7 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A138976: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 10*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -3, a(2) = -18, a(3) = -45, a(4) = -192

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
