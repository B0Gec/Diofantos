While total time consumed by now, scale:24652/34371, seq_id:A173657, order:20 took:
 73.2 seconds, i.e. 1.22 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A173657: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - 4*a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
