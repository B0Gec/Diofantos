While total time consumed by now, scale:15617/34371, seq_id:A104522, order:20 took:
 63.3 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A104522: 
a(n) = -2*n - 3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
