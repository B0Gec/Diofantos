While total time consumed by now, scale:21236/34371, seq_id:A163383, order:20 took:
 68.9 seconds, i.e. 1.15 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A163383: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 10) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
