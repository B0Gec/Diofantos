 48.3 seconds, i.e. 0.8 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A097948: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = -13, a(3) = 49

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
