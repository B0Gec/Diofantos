 62.6 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A114647: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
