While total time consumed by now, scale:25134/34371, seq_id:A178706, order:20 took:
 47.5 seconds, i.e. 0.79 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A178706: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 70

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
