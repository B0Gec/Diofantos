While total time consumed by now, scale:17221/34371, seq_id:A122167, order:20 took:
 48.1 seconds, i.e. 0.8 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A122167: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 7) - 5*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -7*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -3, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
