 66.0 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A036257: 
a(n) = 12500*a(n - 3) - 3125*a(n - 2) + 130*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 130*a(n - 1) + -3125*a(n - 2) + 12500*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 90, a(2) = 9700

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
