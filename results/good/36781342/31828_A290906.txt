 39.3 seconds, i.e. 0.65 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A290906: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 39

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
