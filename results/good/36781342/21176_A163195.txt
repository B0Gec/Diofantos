A163195: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 4) - 35*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + -35*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 539, a(4) = 9801

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
