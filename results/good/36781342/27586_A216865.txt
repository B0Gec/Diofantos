While total time consumed by now, scale:27587/34371, seq_id:A216865, order:20 took:
 125.5 seconds, i.e. 2.09 minutes or 0.035 hours.

A216865: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 8, a(2) = -8, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
