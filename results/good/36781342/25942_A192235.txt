 54.0 seconds, i.e. 0.9 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A192235: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 21

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
