 50.7 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A127981: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 19) - 3*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
