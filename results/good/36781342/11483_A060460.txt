While total time consumed by now, scale:11484/34371, seq_id:A060460, order:20 took:
 87.0 seconds, i.e. 1.45 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A060460: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 5*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 5*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 53

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
