 23.2 seconds, i.e. 0.39 minutes or 0.006 hours.

A037710: 
a(n) = -n + 3*a(n - 20) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 42, a(3) = 210

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
