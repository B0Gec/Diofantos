 47.3 seconds, i.e. 0.79 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A136598: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = -3, a(4) = 0

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
