While total time consumed by now, scale:11919/34371, seq_id:A066280, order:20 took:
 66.2 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A066280: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
