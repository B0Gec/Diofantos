While total time consumed by now, scale:18032/34371, seq_id:A131080, order:20 took:
 61.4 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A131080: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
