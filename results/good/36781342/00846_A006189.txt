While total time consumed by now, scale:847/34371, seq_id:A006189, order:20 took:
 88.9 seconds, i.e. 1.48 minutes or 0.025 hours.

A006189: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
