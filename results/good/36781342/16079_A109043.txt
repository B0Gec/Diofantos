 37.8 seconds, i.e. 0.63 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A109043: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
