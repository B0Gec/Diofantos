While total time consumed by now, scale:16703/34371, seq_id:A116764, order:20 took:
 45.5 seconds, i.e. 0.76 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A116764: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
