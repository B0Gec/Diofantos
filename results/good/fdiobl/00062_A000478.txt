 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A000478: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 5) - 40*a(n - 4) + 51*a(n - 3) - 31*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 82*a(n - 3) + -91*a(n - 4) + 52*a(n - 5) + -12*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 15, a(1) = 105, a(2) = 490, a(3) = 1918, a(4) = 6825, a(5) = 22935

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
