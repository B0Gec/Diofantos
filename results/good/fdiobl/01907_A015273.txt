 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A015273: 
a(n) = 46656*a(n - 3) + 6696*a(n - 2) - 186*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = -185*a(n - 1) + 6882*a(n - 2) + 39960*a(n - 3) + -46656*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -185, a(2) = 41107, a(3) = -8838005

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
