 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A005024: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 43, a(2) = 196, a(3) = 820

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
