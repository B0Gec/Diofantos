 3.5 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A014730: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 17*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 17*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 17*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 49, a(3) = 121, a(4) = 841, a(5) = 2209

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
