 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A014904: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -41*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 443

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
