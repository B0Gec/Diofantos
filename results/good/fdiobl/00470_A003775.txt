 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A003775: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 3) - 32*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -32*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 95, a(3) = 1183

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
