 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A003735: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 44*a(n - 3) - 102*a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 1) + -102*a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 29, a(1) = 1189, a(2) = 49401, a(3) = 2053641

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
