 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A015287: 
a(n) = -1024*a(n - 4) - 320*a(n - 3) + 120*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + 110*a(n - 2) + -440*a(n - 3) + -704*a(n - 4) + 1024*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 231, a(3) = 3311, a(4) = 56287

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
