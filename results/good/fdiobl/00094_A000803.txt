While total time consumed by now, scale:95/27926, seq_id:A000803, order:20 took:
 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A000803: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) - 4
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
