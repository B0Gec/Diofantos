 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A015281: 
a(n) = 2985984*a(n - 3) + 229824*a(n - 2) - 1596*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = -1595*a(n - 1) + 231420*a(n - 2) + 2756160*a(n - 3) + -2985984*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1595, a(2) = 2775445, a(3) = -4793193515

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
