A011906: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 40*a(n - 3) - 206*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 1) + -246*a(n - 2) + 246*a(n - 3) + -41*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 525, a(3) = 17340, a(4) = 586177

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
