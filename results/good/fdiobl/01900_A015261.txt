 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A015261: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 91*a(n - 1) + 910*a(n - 2) + -1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 91, a(2) = 9191

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
