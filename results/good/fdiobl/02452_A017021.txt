 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A017021: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 2016840
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 243, a(1) = 100000, a(2) = 1419857, a(3) = 7962624, a(4) = 28629151, a(5) = 79235168

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
