While total time consumed by now, scale:55/27926, seq_id:A000389, order:20 took:
 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A000389: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
