by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A015289: 
a(n) = -1048576*a(n - 4) - 208896*a(n - 3) + 14144*a(n - 2) + 204*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 205*a(n - 1) + 13940*a(n - 2) + -223040*a(n - 3) + -839680*a(n - 4) + 1048576*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 205, a(2) = 55965, a(3) = 14107485, a(4) = 3625623645

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
