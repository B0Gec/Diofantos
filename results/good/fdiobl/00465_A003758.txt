 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A003758: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 46, a(4) = 193

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
