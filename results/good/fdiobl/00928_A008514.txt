 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A008514: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 48
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 97, a(3) = 337, a(4) = 881

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
