A163199: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 56*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -77*a(n - 2) + 77*a(n - 3) + -22*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 539, a(4) = 9800

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
