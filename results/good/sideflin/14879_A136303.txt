A136303: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 123

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
