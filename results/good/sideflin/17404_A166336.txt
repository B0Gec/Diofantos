A166336: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 39, a(4) = 131

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
