A103819: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
