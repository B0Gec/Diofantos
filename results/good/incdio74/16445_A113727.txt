 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A113727: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 4

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
