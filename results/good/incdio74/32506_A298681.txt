 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A298681: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -9*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 32

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
