 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A000919: 
a(n) = -24*a(n - 4) + 50*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 24

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
