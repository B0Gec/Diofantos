 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A023950: 
a(n) = -378*a(n - 4) + 537*a(n - 3) - 181*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -181*a(n - 2) + 537*a(n - 3) + -378*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 348, a(3) = 4378

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
