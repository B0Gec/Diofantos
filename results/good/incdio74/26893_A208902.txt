 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A208902: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 34, a(4) = 78

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
