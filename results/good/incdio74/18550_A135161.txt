 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A135161: 
a(n) = -210*a(n - 4) + 247*a(n - 3) - 101*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -101*a(n - 2) + 247*a(n - 3) + -210*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -2, a(1) = -3, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 183

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
