 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A219390: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 52, a(4) = 60

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
