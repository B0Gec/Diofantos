 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A100190: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 3) - 22*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 147, a(3) = 760

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
