 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A113066: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = -10

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
