 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A224460: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 91, a(1) = 263, a(2) = 589, a(3) = 1126, a(4) = 1940

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
