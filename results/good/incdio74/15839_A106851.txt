 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A106851: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 16*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 37

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
