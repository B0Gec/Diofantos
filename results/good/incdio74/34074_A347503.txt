 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A347503: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 57, a(4) = 115

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
