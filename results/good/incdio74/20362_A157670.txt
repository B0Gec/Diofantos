 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A157670: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 258065, a(1) = 1530170, a(2) = 3865157

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
