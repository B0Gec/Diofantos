 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A145131: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 16

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
