 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A322783: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 9

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
