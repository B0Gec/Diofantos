 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A291391: 
a(n) = -36*a(n - 4) - 72*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + -72*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 120, a(2) = 1080, a(3) = 9180

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
