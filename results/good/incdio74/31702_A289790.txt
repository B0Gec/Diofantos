 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A289790: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 385

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
