 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A023548: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 21

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
