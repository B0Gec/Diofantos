A231183: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
