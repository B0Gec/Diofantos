 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A116768: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - 11*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -18*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
