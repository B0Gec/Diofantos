A281746: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 10, a(6) = 12, a(7) = 15

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
