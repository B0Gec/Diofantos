 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A129026: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 108, a(3) = 282, a(4) = 600

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
