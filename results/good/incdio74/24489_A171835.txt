 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A171835: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 29, a(5) = 41

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
