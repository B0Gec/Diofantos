 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A178778: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 5) + 21*a(n - 4) - 12*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -12*a(n - 3) + 21*a(n - 4) + -9*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 42

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
