 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A156857: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -9, a(3) = 10

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
