 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A126641: 
a(n) = 120*a(n - 5) - 274*a(n - 4) + 225*a(n - 3) - 85*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -85*a(n - 2) + 225*a(n - 3) + -274*a(n - 4) + 120*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 73, a(2) = 537, a(3) = 3625, a(4) = 22809

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
