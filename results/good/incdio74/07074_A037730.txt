 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A037730: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 147, a(4) = 590

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
