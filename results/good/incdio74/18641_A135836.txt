 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A135836: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 82, a(3) = 254, a(4) = 677

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
