 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A037757: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 231, a(3) = 2310

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
