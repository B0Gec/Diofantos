A213489: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 37, a(4) = 64, a(5) = 103

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
