 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A129641: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 200, a(2) = 611, a(3) = 1227, a(4) = 2291, a(5) = 4620, a(6) = 8180

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
