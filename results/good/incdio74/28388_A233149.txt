A233149: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = -24, a(3) = 13, a(4) = -113, a(5) = 28, a(6) = -316, a(7) = 49

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
