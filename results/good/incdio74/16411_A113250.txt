 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A113250: 
a(n) = 256*a(n - 4) + 64*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + 256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 64

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
