 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A109242: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 3) - 1110*a(n - 2) + 111*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 111, a(2) = 11211

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
