 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A326347: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 4) - 12*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -12*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 36, a(1) = 240, a(2) = 780, a(3) = 2952

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
