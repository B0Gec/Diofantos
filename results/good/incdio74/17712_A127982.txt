 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A127982: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 57, a(4) = 147

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
