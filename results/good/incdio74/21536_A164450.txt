 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A164450: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 78

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
