 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A127619: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 12*a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -11*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 117

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
