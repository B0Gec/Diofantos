 5.0 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A118120: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 88, a(5) = 207, a(6) = 340

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
