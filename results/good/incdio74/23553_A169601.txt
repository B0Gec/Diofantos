 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A169601: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 3) - 1110*a(n - 2) + 111*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 83, a(2) = 9803

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
