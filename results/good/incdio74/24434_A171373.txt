 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A171373: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 36, a(4) = 76

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
