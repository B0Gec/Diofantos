 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A033506: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 10*a(n - 4) + 14*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 14*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 131, a(4) = 823, a(5) = 5096

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
