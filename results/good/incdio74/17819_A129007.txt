 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A129007: 
a(n) = -2401*a(n - 4) + 1372*a(n - 3) - 294*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -294*a(n - 2) + 1372*a(n - 3) + -2401*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 14, a(1) = 588, a(2) = 12348, a(3) = 192080

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
