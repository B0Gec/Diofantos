 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A176900: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -4, a(2) = -24, a(3) = -32

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
