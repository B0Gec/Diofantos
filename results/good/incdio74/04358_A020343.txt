 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A020343: 
a(n) = 360*a(n - 3) - 157*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -157*a(n - 2) + 360*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 327

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
