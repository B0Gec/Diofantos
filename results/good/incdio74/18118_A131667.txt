 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A131667: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 4, a(4) = -3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
