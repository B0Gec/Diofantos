 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A106352: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 21

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
