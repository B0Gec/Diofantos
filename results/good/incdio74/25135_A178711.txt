 4.0 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A178711: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 6) - 11*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + -11*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 109, a(4) = 555, a(5) = 2787

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
