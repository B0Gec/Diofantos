 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A184337: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 3) - 1110*a(n - 2) + 111*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 81, a(2) = 8811

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
