A302404: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 4, a(6) = 4

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
