 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A105838: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 398*a(n - 3) + 398*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 398*a(n - 2) + -398*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 39, a(2) = 159, a(3) = 15720, a(4) = 63480

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
