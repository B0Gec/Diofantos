 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163202: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) - 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = -118, a(4) = 2079

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
