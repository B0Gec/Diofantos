 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A187919: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 4) - 24*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 256, a(3) = 1912

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
