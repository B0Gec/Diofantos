A070362: 
a(n) = a(n - 10)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 37, a(5) = 23, a(6) = 25, a(7) = 31, a(8) = 5, a(9) = 15

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
