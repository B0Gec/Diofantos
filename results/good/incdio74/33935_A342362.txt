A342362: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 76, a(4) = 145, a(5) = 254

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
