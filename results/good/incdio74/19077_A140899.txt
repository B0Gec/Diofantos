 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A140899: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
