 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A178710: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 47, a(4) = 193

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
