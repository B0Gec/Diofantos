 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A178829: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 5) - 15*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 139, a(4) = 979

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
