 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A055245: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 28, a(5) = 61

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
