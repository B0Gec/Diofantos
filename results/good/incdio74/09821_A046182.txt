 3.6 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A046182: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 98*a(n - 3) + 98*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 98*a(n - 2) + -98*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 153, a(3) = 638, a(4) = 15041

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
