by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A072711: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 60
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 32, a(4) = 38, a(5) = 49, a(6) = 52, a(7) = 58, a(8) = 71

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
