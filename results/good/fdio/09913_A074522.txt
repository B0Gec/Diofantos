 5.8 seconds, i.e. 0.1 minutes or 0.002 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 17. 
A074522: 
a(n) = -24*a(n - 17) + 6*a(n - 16) + 8*a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) - 54*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1) + 18
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -69*a(n - 2) + 54*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 118

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
