 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A110514: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 3, a(5) = -1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
