 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A110211: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1) - 3
truth: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = -15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
