While total time consumed by now, scale:498/27927, seq_id:A004301, order:20 took:
 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A004301: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 5) - 40*a(n - 4) + 51*a(n - 3) - 31*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 82*a(n - 3) + -91*a(n - 4) + 52*a(n - 5) + -12*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 58, a(3) = 328, a(4) = 1452, a(5) = 5610

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
