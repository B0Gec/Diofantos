 3.5 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 16. 
A094027: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) + 100*a(n - 2) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 101*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 100, a(3) = 101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
