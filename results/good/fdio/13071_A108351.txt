 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A108351: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
