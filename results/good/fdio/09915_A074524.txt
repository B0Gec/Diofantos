 5.2 seconds, i.e. 0.09 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 17. 
A074524: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 17) + 3*a(n - 16) + 8*a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) - 63*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1) + 15
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -79*a(n - 2) + 63*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 131

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
