 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A095129: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 12*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
