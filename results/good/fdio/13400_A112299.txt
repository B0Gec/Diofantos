 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A112299: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
