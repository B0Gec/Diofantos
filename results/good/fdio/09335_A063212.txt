 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A063212: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
