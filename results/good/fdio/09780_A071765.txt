 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A071765: 
a(n) = 144*a(n - 3) - 96*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1) - 264
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -115*a(n - 2) + 240*a(n - 3) + -144*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 96, a(2) = 1560, a(3) = 20160

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
