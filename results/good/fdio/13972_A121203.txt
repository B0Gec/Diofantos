 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A121203: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 3) - 47*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) + 48
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -60*a(n - 2) + 82*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 224

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
