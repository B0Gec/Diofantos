 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A060189: 
a(n) = 45*a(n - 5) - 129*a(n - 4) + 134*a(n - 3) - 62*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) - 16
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -75*a(n - 2) + 196*a(n - 3) + -263*a(n - 4) + 174*a(n - 5) + -45*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 230, a(3) = 1682, a(4) = 10543, a(5) = 60657

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
