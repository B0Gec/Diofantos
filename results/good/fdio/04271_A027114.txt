While total time consumed by now, scale:4272/27927, seq_id:A027114, order:20 took:
 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A027114: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
