 10.9 seconds, i.e. 0.18 minutes or 0.003 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 15. 
A089907: 
a(n) = 117*a(n - 15) - 37*a(n - 14) + 2*a(n - 13) + 100*a(n - 3) - 120*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1) - 26
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -141*a(n - 2) + 220*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 483, a(3) = 7785

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
