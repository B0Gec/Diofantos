 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A054401: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 12
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 60

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
