 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A053655: 
a(n) = 1000000*a(n - 3) - 111000*a(n - 2) + 1110*a(n - 1) - 10989
truth: 
a(n) = 1111*a(n - 1) + -112110*a(n - 2) + 1111000*a(n - 3) + -1000000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1221, a(2) = 1233321, a(3) = 1234444321

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
