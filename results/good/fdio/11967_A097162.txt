by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A097162: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 2) - 6
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + -9*a(n - 3) + -20*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
