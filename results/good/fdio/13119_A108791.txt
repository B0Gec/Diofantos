 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A108791: 
a(n) = -a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) - 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -19*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -5, a(1) = 121, a(2) = -2205

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
