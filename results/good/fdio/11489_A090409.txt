 19.0 seconds, i.e. 0.32 minutes or 0.005 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 18. 
A090409: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 18) + 8*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) + 8*a(n - 14) - a(n - 13) + 8*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 6
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
