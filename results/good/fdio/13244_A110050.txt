 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A110050: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 16*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) - 27
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 73, a(3) = 369, a(4) = 1697

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
