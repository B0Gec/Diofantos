 5.4 seconds, i.e. 0.09 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 18. 
A074504: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 18) + 8*a(n - 17) - a(n - 16) - 16*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 69

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
