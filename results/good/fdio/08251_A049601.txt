 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A049601: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
