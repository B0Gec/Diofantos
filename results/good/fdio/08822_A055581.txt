 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A055581: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -25*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 3) + -28*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 39, a(3) = 150, a(4) = 501

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
