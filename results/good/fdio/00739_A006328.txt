 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A006328: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 79, a(3) = 223, a(4) = 579, a(5) = 1432

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
