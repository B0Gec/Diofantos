 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A111643: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = -34, a(3) = 136

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
