 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A065497: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
