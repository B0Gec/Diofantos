 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A120948: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 3) - 23*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 64
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -32*a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 50, a(3) = 176

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
