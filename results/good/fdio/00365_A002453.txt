 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A002453: 
a(n) = -225*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -259*a(n - 2) + 225*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 966

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
