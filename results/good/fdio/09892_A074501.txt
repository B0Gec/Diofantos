 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A074501: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 30

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
