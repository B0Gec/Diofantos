 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A026657: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
