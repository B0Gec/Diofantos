 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A096978: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -14*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
