 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 15. 
A093146: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 15) + 8*a(n - 14) - a(n - 13) - 50*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1) - 11
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -50*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
