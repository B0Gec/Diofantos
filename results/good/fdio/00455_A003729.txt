 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A003729: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 3) - 41*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -41*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 176, a(2) = 2911, a(3) = 48301

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
