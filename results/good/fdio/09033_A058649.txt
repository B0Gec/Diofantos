 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A058649: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 5) - 80*a(n - 4) + 80*a(n - 3) - 40*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3) + -80*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 132, a(4) = 680

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
