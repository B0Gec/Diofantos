 5.0 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 15. 
A089908: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 15) - 17*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) + 100*a(n - 3) - 120*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1) - 4
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -141*a(n - 2) + 220*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 609, a(3) = 9555

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
