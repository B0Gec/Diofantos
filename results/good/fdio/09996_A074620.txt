 4.8 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 18. 
A074620: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 48*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
