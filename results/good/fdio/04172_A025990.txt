 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A025990: 
a(n) = -660*a(n - 4) + 632*a(n - 3) - 195*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -195*a(n - 2) + 632*a(n - 3) + -660*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 381, a(3) = 5096

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
