 3.6 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A006491: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 28

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
