 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A003769: 
a(n) = -a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 75

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
