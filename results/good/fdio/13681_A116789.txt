 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A116789: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 33
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 231, a(6) = 650, a(7) = 1668

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
