 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A005570: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 16
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 17, a(1) = 50, a(2) = 99

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
