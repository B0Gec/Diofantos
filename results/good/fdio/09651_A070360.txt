 4.0 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 9. 
A070360: 
a(n) = 38 - a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9) + 1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 7, a(7) = 21, a(8) = 25, a(9) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
