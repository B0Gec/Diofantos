 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A116820: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 3) + -14*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 75

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
