 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A060483: 
a(n) = 80*a(n - 3) - 68*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1) + 9
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 148*a(n - 3) + -80*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 57, a(2) = 717, a(3) = 7845

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
