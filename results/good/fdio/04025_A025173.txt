 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A025173: 
a(n) = -81*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 3) - 22*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -5, a(3) = -42

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
