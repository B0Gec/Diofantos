 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A001789: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 160

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
