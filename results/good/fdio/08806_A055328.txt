A055328: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -3*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 28, a(4) = 53, a(5) = 91, a(6) = 146, a(7) = 223

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
