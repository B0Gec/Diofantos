 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A053090: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 6, a(6) = 12, a(7) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
