 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A118109: 
a(n) = 10000*a(n - 3) + 10000*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1) + 112
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 10001*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -10000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 111, a(2) = 10001, a(3) = 1110111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
