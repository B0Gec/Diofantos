 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A070315: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 5) - 40*a(n - 4) + 51*a(n - 3) - 31*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 82*a(n - 3) + -91*a(n - 4) + 52*a(n - 5) + -12*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 161, a(3) = 813, a(4) = 3361, a(5) = 12421

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
