A004058: 
a(n) = -120*a(n - 5) + 34*a(n - 4) + 83*a(n - 3) - 57*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -57*a(n - 2) + 83*a(n - 3) + 34*a(n - 4) + -120*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 99, a(3) = 686, a(4) = 4305

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
