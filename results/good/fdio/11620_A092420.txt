 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 16. 
A092420: 
a(n) = -78*a(n - 16) - 9*a(n - 15) + 2*a(n - 14) - a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 11
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 90

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
