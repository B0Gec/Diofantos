 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A110210: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1) - 5
truth: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
