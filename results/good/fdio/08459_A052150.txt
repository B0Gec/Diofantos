 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A052150: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 82

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
