 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A006235: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) + 26*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 4
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 52*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 75, a(3) = 384, a(4) = 1805, a(5) = 8100

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
