While total time consumed by now, scale:586/27927, seq_id:A005120, order:20 took:
 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A005120: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = -1, a(5) = -1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
