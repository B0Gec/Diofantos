While total time consumed by now, scale:676/27927, seq_id:A005910, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A005910: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 96
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 38, a(2) = 201, a(3) = 586

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
