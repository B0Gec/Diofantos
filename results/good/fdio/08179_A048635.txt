 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A048635: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
