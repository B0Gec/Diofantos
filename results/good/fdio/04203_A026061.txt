 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A026061: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 22, a(1) = 40, a(2) = 63, a(3) = 92, a(4) = 127, a(5) = 170, a(6) = 220

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
