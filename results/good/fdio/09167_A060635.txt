 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A060635: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 19*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 450, a(4) = 3200

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
