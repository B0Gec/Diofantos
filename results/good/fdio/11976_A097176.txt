by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A097176: 
a(n) = -650*a(n - 4) + 51*a(n - 2) - 120
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 51*a(n - 2) + -51*a(n - 3) + -650*a(n - 4) + 650*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 186, a(4) = 811

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
