 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A066067: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 18, a(6) = 29, a(7) = 49

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
