 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A110683: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 5) - 12*a(n - 4) - 20*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) - 7*a(n - 1) - 45
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -7, a(2) = 21, a(3) = -79, a(4) = 279, a(5) = -997

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
