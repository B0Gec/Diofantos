 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A114849: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 28*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 257

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
