 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A054146: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 20*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 29

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
