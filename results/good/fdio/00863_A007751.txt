 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A007751: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 120

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
