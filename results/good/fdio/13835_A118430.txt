 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A118430: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 10

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
