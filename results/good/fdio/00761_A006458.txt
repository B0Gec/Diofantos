 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A006458: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 12
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5) + -6*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 31, a(3) = 115, a(4) = 391, a(5) = 1267

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
