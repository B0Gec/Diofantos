 5.4 seconds, i.e. 0.09 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 18. 
A074622: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 18) - 12*a(n - 17) - 6*a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) - 56*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1) - 6
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
