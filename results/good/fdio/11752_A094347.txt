 503.3 seconds, i.e. 8.39 minutes or 0.14 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 15. 
A094347: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - 3*a(n - 4) + 40*a(n - 3) + 24*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1) + 20
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
