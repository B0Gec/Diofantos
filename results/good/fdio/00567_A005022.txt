 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A005022: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 100

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
