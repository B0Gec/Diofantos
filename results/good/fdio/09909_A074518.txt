 6.1 seconds, i.e. 0.1 minutes or 0.002 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 18. 
A074518: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 18) + 3*a(n - 17) + 7*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 40*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) - 12
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -53*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 90

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
