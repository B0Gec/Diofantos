 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A090020: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 3) - 31*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -41*a(n - 2) + 61*a(n - 3) + -30*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 91

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
