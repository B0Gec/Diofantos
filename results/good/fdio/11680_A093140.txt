 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 17. 
A093140: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 17) - 3*a(n - 16) + 10*a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
