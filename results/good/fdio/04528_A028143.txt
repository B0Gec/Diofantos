A028143: 
a(n) = -2880*a(n - 4) + 1728*a(n - 3) - 364*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -364*a(n - 2) + 1728*a(n - 3) + -2880*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 660, a(3) = 11200

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
