While total time consumed by now, scale:9874/27927, seq_id:A073950, order:20 took:
 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A073950: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 5) - 36*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 30

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
