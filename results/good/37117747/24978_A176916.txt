 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A176916: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 19) - a(n - 17) + 5*a(n - 14) - a(n - 13) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
