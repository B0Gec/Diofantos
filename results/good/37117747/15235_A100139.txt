 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A100139: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + 8*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
