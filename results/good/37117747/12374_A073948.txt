While total time consumed by now, scale:12375/34371, seq_id:A073948, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A073948: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 6) - 9*a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 30

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
