 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A036216: 
a(n) = -81*a(n - 5) + 27*a(n - 4) + 54*a(n - 3) - 42*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -54*a(n - 2) + 108*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 90, a(3) = 540

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
