While total time consumed by now, scale:14449/34371, seq_id:A093916, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A093916: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 53

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
