 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A094829: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
