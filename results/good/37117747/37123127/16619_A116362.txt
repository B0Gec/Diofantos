While total time consumed by now, scale:16620/34371, seq_id:A116362, order:20 took:
 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A116362: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) - 2*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
