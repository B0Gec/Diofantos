While total time consumed by now, scale:16457/34371, seq_id:A113920, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A113920: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
