While total time consumed by now, scale:33126/34371, seq_id:A317640, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A317640: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 20, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
