 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A116521: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
