While total time consumed by now, scale:28076/34371, seq_id:A227006, order:20 took:
 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A227006: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 20) - 2*a(n - 14) - 2*a(n - 8) - 16*a(n - 7) + 19*a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
