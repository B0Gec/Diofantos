While total time consumed by now, scale:2472/34371, seq_id:A014905, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014905: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 21*a(n - 9) - 20*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -43*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 486

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
