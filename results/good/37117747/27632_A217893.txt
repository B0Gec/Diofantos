While total time consumed by now, scale:27633/34371, seq_id:A217893, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A217893: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -17, a(1) = 13, a(2) = -7, a(3) = 73

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
