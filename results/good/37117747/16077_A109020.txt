While total time consumed by now, scale:16078/34371, seq_id:A109020, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A109020: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 7) - 10*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
