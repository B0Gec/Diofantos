A028217: 
a(n) = -6480*a(n - 4) + 2988*a(n - 3) - 504*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37*a(n - 1) + -504*a(n - 2) + 2988*a(n - 3) + -6480*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 865, a(3) = 16345

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
