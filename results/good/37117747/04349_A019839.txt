 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A019839: 
a(n) = 300*a(n - 3) - 140*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -140*a(n - 2) + 300*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 301

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
