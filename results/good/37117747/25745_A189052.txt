While total time consumed by now, scale:25746/34371, seq_id:A189052, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A189052: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
