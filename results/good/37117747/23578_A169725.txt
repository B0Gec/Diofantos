 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A169725: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 7) - 12*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 27*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 70, a(2) = 532

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
