 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A162983: 
a(n) = -36*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 90, a(3) = 810

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
