 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A174785: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -1, a(3) = -1, a(4) = -5, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
