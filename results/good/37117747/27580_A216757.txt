 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A216757: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -3, a(2) = -15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
