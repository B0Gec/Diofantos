 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A003738: 
a(n) = -56832*a(n - 4) - 3328*a(n - 3) - 128*a(n - 2) + 60*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 1) + -128*a(n - 2) + -3328*a(n - 3) + -56832*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 24, a(1) = 1920, a(2) = 70184, a(3) = 2154592

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
