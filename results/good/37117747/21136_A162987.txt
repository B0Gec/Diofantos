 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A162987: 
a(n) = -45*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + -45*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 110, a(3) = 1100

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
