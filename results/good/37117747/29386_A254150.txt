 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A254150: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) - 19*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 73

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
