 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016312: 
a(n) = 126*a(n - 4) + 31*a(n - 3) - 77*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -95*a(n - 2) + 126*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 229

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
