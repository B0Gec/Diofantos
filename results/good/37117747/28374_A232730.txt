 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A232730: 
a(n) = -100*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + -100*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 45, a(2) = 495

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
