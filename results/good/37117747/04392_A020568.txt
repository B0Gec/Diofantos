 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020568: 
a(n) = 600*a(n - 3) - 230*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -230*a(n - 2) + 600*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 499

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
