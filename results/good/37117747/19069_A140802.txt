 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A140802: 
a(n) = -4096*a(n - 4) + 2048*a(n - 3) - 384*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -384*a(n - 2) + 2048*a(n - 3) + -4096*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 640, a(3) = 10240

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
