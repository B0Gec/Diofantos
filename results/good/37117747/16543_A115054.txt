While total time consumed by now, scale:16544/34371, seq_id:A115054, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A115054: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 16, a(2) = -8, a(3) = -36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
