 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A289804: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 10*a(n - 7) - 5*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 29

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
