While total time consumed by now, scale:31455/34371, seq_id:A286850, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A286850: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 52

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
