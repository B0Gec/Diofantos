 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A134006: 
a(n) = -105*a(n - 7) - 34*a(n - 6) + 56*a(n - 5) + 91*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 3) - 56*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -86*a(n - 2) + 176*a(n - 3) + -105*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 84, a(3) = 496

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
