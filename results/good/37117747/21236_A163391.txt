 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163391: 
a(n) = -28*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + -28*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 576, a(4) = 4608

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
