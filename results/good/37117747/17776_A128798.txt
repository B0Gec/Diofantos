 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A128798: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 36*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
