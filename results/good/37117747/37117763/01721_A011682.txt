While total time consumed by now, scale:1722/34371, seq_id:A011682, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A011682: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
