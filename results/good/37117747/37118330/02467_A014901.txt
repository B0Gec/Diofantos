While total time consumed by now, scale:2468/34371, seq_id:A014901, order:20 took:
 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014901: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 18*a(n - 9) - 17*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -37*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 363

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
