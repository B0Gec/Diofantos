While total time consumed by now, scale:2501/34371, seq_id:A014934, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014934: 
a(n) = 289*a(n - 11) - 34*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 289*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -323*a(n - 2) + 289*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 902

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
