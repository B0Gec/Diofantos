While total time consumed by now, scale:2493/34371, seq_id:A014926, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014926: 
a(n) = 121*a(n - 7) - 22*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 121*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -143*a(n - 2) + 121*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 386

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
