While total time consumed by now, scale:2695/34371, seq_id:A015318, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A015318: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) + a(n - 13) + a(n - 11) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
