 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016321: 
a(n) = 180*a(n - 4) + 52*a(n - 3) - 107*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -128*a(n - 2) + 180*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 313

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
