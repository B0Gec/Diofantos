A265380: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 111, a(3) = 1110, a(4) = 11101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
