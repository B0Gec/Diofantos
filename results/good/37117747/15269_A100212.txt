While total time consumed by now, scale:15270/34371, seq_id:A100212, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A100212: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
