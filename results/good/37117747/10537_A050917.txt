 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A050917: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 4) - 12*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 73

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
