 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163745: 
a(n) = -861*a(n - 5) + 41*a(n - 4) + 41*a(n - 3) + 41*a(n - 2) + 41*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 41*a(n - 1) + 41*a(n - 2) + 41*a(n - 3) + 41*a(n - 4) + -861*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 43, a(2) = 1806, a(3) = 75852, a(4) = 3185784

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
