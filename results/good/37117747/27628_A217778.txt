While total time consumed by now, scale:27629/34371, seq_id:A217778, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A217778: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 7) + 10*a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
