 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A135399: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + 6*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
