While total time consumed by now, scale:33346/34371, seq_id:A323266, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A323266: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 6*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 51

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
