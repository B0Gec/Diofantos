While total time consumed by now, scale:19937/34371, seq_id:A154615, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A154615: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 14) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 64, a(5) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
