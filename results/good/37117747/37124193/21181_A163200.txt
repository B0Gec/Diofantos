While total time consumed by now, scale:21182/34371, seq_id:A163200, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163200: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 20*a(n - 4) - 35*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 134

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
