 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A166132: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 8) - 13*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 36*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -49*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 469

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
