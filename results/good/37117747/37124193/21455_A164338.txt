 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A164338: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 10) + a(n - 8) + 10*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 12334444, a(1) = 55667777, a(2) = 123334444, a(3) = 556667777

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
