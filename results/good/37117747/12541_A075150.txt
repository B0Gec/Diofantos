While total time consumed by now, scale:12542/34371, seq_id:A075150, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A075150: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
