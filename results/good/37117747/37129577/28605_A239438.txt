 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A239438: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
