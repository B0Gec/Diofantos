While total time consumed by now, scale:28775/34371, seq_id:A242725, order:20 took:
 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A242725: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
