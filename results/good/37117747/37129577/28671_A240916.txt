While total time consumed by now, scale:28672/34371, seq_id:A240916, order:20 took:
 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A240916: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 19) - 8*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
