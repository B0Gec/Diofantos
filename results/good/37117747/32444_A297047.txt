 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A297047: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2016, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
