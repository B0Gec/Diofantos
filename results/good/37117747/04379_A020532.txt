 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020532: 
a(n) = 512*a(n - 3) - 336*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -336*a(n - 2) + 512*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 70, a(2) = 1292

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
