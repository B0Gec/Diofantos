A235789: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -2, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 8

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
