While total time consumed by now, scale:15645/34371, seq_id:A104720, order:20 took:
 3.5 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A104720: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - 10*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - 10*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -11*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 112, a(3) = 1122

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
