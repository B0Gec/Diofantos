While total time consumed by now, scale:13023/34371, seq_id:A079460, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A079460: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 23

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
