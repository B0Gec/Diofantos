While total time consumed by now, scale:482/34371, seq_id:A003478, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A003478: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
