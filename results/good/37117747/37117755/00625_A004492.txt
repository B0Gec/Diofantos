A004492: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 8, a(6) = 0, a(7) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
