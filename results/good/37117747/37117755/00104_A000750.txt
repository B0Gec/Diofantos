While total time consumed by now, scale:105/34371, seq_id:A000750, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A000750: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -5, a(2) = 15, a(3) = -35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
