While total time consumed by now, scale:523/34371, seq_id:A003747, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A003747: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 75*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 75*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 76*a(n - 1) + -76*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 56, a(1) = 4181, a(2) = 313501

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
