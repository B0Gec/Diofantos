While total time consumed by now, scale:805/34371, seq_id:A005970, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A005970: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 75

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
