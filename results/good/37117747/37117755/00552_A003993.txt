While total time consumed by now, scale:553/34371, seq_id:A003993, order:20 took:
 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A003993: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 46

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
