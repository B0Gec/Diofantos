 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A074528: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 5) + 11*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -36*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 49

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
