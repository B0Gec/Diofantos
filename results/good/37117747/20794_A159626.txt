A159626: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 545, a(1) = 577, a(2) = 613, a(3) = 2657, a(4) = 2885, a(5) = 3133

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
