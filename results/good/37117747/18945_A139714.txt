While total time consumed by now, scale:18946/34371, seq_id:A139714, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A139714: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + 4*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
