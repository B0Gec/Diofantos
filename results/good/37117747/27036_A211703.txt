 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A211703: 
a(n) = -a(n - 14) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 12, a(6) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
