 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A172163: 
a(n) = -9900*a(n - 3) - 101*a(n - 2) + 102*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 102*a(n - 1) + -101*a(n - 2) + -9900*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
