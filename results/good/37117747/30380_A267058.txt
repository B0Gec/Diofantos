 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A267058: 
a(n) = -256*a(n - 6) + 256*a(n - 4) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 256*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -256*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 19, a(4) = 256, a(5) = 255

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
