While total time consumed by now, scale:25537/34371, seq_id:A184750, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A184750: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
