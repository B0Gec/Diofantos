While total time consumed by now, scale:26381/34371, seq_id:A198397, order:20 took:
 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A198397: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 7*a(n - 11) - 6*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
