 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A036255: 
a(n) = 12500*a(n - 3) - 3125*a(n - 2) + 130*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 130*a(n - 1) + -3125*a(n - 2) + 12500*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 945, a(2) = 98475

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
