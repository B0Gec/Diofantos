 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A066983: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
