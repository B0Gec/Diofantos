While total time consumed by now, scale:34193/34371, seq_id:A350717, order:20 took:
 3.6 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A350717: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
