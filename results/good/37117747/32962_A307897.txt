A307897: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 0, a(6) = 1, a(7) = 0, a(8) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
