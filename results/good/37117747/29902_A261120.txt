While total time consumed by now, scale:29903/34371, seq_id:A261120, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A261120: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 5) - 10*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 134

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
