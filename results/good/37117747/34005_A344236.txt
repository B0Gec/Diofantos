 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A344236: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
