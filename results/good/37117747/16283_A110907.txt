While total time consumed by now, scale:16284/34371, seq_id:A110907, order:20 took:
 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A110907: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 50, a(3) = 108

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
