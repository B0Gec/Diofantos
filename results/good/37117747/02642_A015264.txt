 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A015264: 
a(n) = -1728*a(n - 3) + 1596*a(n - 2) + 133*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 133*a(n - 1) + 1596*a(n - 2) + -1728*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 133, a(2) = 19285

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
