While total time consumed by now, scale:2211/34371, seq_id:A014230, order:20 took:
 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A014230: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 17) + a(n - 15) - a(n - 11) + a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
