 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A075412: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 10) - 110*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
