A020718: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 49, a(5) = 83

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
