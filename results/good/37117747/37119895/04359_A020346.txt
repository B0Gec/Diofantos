 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020346: 
a(n) = 400*a(n - 3) - 170*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -170*a(n - 2) + 400*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 359

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
