 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020972: 
a(n) = 756*a(n - 3) - 255*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -255*a(n - 2) + 756*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 529

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
