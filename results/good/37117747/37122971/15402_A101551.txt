While total time consumed by now, scale:15403/34371, seq_id:A101551, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A101551: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
