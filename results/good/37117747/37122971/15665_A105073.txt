 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A105073: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 44

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
