While total time consumed by now, scale:1765/34371, seq_id:A011725, order:20 took:
 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A011725: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) + 2*a(n - 18) - a(n - 16) - 2*a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) + a(n - 11) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + ...0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2016, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
