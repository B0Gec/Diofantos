While total time consumed by now, scale:16427/34371, seq_id:A113436, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A113436: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 26

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
