 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A214525: 
a(n) = -49*a(n - 5) + 26*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 49*a(n - 3) + -49*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
