 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A267454: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 23, a(6) = 30, a(7) = 40

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
