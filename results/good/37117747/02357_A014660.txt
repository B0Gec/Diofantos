While total time consumed by now, scale:2358/34371, seq_id:A014660, order:20 took:
 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A014660: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 17) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
