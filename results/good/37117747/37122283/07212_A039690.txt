 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A039690: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 20

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
