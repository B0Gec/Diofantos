 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A113841: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 12) + a(n - 9) + 64*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 71

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
