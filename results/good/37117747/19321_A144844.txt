While total time consumed by now, scale:19322/34371, seq_id:A144844, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A144844: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 5) - 20*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
