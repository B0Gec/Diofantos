A164418: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 66, a(4) = 115, a(5) = 200, a(6) = 347

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
