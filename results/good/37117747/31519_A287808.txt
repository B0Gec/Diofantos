 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A287808: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 6) - 8*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 197

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
