 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064747: 
a(n) = 81*a(n - 6) - 18*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 81*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -99*a(n - 2) + 81*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 163

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
