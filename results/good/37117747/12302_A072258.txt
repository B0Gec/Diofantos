 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A072258: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 8) - 8*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 16*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 69

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
