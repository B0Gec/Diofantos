 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A215634: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) - 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = -6, a(2) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
