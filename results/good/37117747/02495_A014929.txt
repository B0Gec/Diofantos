While total time consumed by now, scale:2496/34371, seq_id:A014929, order:20 took:
 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014929: 
a(n) = 196*a(n - 7) - 28*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 196*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -224*a(n - 2) + 196*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 617

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
