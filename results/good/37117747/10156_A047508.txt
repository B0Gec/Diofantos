 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A047508: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
