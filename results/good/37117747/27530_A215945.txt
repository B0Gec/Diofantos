 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A215945: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 4) - 24*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 33*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -3, a(1) = -105, a(2) = -3387

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
