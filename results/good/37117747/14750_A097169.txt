 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A097169: 
a(n) = 90*a(n - 7) - 19*a(n - 5) - 90*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 19*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 19*a(n - 2) + -19*a(n - 3) + -90*a(n - 4) + 90*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 52, a(4) = 133

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
