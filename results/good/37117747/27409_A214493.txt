While total time consumed by now, scale:27410/34371, seq_id:A214493, order:20 took:
 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A214493: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 17) - a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 17, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 89

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
