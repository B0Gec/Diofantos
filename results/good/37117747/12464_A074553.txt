 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074553: 
a(n) = 120*a(n - 3) - 79*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -79*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 98

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
