 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A123589: 
a(n) = -20*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 3) + -20*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 93

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
