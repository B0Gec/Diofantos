 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A127985: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 14) - 3*a(n - 12) + a(n - 11) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
