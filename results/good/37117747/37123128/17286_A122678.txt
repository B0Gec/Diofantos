While total time consumed by now, scale:17287/34371, seq_id:A122678, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A122678: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
