While total time consumed by now, scale:17490/34371, seq_id:A124400, order:20 took:
 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A124400: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - 2*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
