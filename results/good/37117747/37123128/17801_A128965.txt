 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A128965: 
a(n) = -2401*a(n - 4) + 1372*a(n - 3) - 294*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -294*a(n - 2) + 1372*a(n - 3) + -2401*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 294, a(2) = 8232, a(3) = 144060

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
