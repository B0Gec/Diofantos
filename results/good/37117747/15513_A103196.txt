 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A103196: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
