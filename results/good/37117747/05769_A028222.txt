A028222: 
a(n) = -6160*a(n - 4) + 2826*a(n - 3) - 481*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -481*a(n - 2) + 2826*a(n - 3) + -6160*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 815, a(3) = 14850

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
