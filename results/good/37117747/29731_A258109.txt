 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A258109: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
