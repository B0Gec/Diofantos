A332751: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 108, a(3) = 400, a(4) = 1486, a(5) = 5516

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
