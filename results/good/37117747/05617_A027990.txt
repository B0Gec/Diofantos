 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A027990: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 65

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
