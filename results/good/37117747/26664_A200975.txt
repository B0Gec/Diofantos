While total time consumed by now, scale:26665/34371, seq_id:A200975, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A200975: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
