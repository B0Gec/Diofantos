 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A199626: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -4, a(2) = -6, a(3) = -8, a(4) = -7, a(5) = -12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
