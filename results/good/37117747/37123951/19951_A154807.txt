 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A154807: 
a(n) = -100000*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 100000*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 100000*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -100000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 11111, a(1) = 1111100000, a(2) = 111110000011111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
