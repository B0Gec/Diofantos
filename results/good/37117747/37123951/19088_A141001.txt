While total time consumed by now, scale:19089/34371, seq_id:A141001, order:20 took:
 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A141001: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
