While total time consumed by now, scale:19675/34371, seq_id:A152494, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A152494: 
a(n) = 90*a(n - 5) + 21*a(n - 4) + 37*a(n - 3) - 54*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -69*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
