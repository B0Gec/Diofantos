While total time consumed by now, scale:2483/34371, seq_id:A014916, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A014916: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 10) - 8*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 16*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 57

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
