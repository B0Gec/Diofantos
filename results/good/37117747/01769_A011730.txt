While total time consumed by now, scale:1770/34371, seq_id:A011730, order:20 took:
 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A011730: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 17) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + ...0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
