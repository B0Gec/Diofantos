 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A021179: 
a(n) = a(n - 19) + a(n - 10) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
