While total time consumed by now, scale:2474/34371, seq_id:A014907, order:20 took:
 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014907: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 22*a(n - 9) - 21*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 531

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
