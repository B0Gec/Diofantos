A225831: 
a(n) = 262144*a(n - 4) - 18432*a(n - 3) - 1920*a(n - 2) + 144*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 144*a(n - 1) + -1920*a(n - 2) + -18432*a(n - 3) + 262144*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 72, a(2) = 4224, a(3) = 529920

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
