 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A074529: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 29*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -41*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 62

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
