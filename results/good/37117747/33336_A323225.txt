While total time consumed by now, scale:33337/34371, seq_id:A323225, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A323225: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2020, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
