While total time consumed by now, scale:16729/34371, seq_id:A116790, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A116790: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 74

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
