 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A212962: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - 3*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
