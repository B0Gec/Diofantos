 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A015265: 
a(n) = -2197*a(n - 3) + 2041*a(n - 2) + 157*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 157*a(n - 1) + 2041*a(n - 2) + -2197*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 157, a(2) = 26690

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
