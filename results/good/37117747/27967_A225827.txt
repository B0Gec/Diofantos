 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A225827: 
a(n) = 256*a(n - 4) - 96*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + -96*a(n - 3) + 256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 168

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
