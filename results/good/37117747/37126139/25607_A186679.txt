 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A186679: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = -4

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
