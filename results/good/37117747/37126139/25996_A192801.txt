 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192801: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
