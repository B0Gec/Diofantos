 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A124101: 
a(n) = 4200*a(n - 3) - 943*a(n - 2) + 56*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 1) + -943*a(n - 2) + 4200*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 56, a(2) = 2193

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
