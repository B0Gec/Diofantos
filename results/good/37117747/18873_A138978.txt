 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A138978: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 4) - 21*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 121, a(2) = 1665

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
