 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A016909: 
a(n) = 108*a(n - 4) + 33*a(n - 3) - 59*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -75*a(n - 2) + 108*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 181

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
