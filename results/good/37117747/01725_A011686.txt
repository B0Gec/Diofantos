 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A011686: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
