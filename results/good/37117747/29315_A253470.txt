While total time consumed by now, scale:29316/34371, seq_id:A253470, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A253470: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 8*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
