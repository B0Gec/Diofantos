 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A153173: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 15*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 15*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 41, a(2) = 341, a(3) = 2161, a(4) = 15251

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
