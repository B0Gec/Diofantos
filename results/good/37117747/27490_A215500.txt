While total time consumed by now, scale:27491/34371, seq_id:A215500, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A215500: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
