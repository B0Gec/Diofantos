 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074560: 
a(n) = 216*a(n - 3) - 123*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -123*a(n - 2) + 216*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 154

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
