While total time consumed by now, scale:12554/34371, seq_id:A075415, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A075415: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 10) - 110*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 4356

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
