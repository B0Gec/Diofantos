 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A069417: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 5) + 32*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 147, a(3) = 1231

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
