A069534: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 10) + 10*a(n - 9) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 10*a(n - 9) + -10*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 25, a(7) = 35, a(8) = 45, a(9) = 55

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
