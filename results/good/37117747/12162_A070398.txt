A070398: 
a(n) = a(n - 14)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 4, a(6) = 24, a(7) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
