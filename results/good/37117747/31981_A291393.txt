While total time consumed by now, scale:31982/34371, seq_id:A291393, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291393: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 8) - 4*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 83

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
