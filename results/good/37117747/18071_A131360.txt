While total time consumed by now, scale:18072/34371, seq_id:A131360, order:20 took:
 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A131360: 
a(n) = -a(n - 12) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 0, a(6) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
