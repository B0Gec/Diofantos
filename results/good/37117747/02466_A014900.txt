While total time consumed by now, scale:2467/34371, seq_id:A014900, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A014900: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 17*a(n - 9) - 16*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 326

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
