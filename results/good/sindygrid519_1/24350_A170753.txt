avg sindy: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 33*a(n - 1)
False  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:24351/34371, seq_id:A170753, order:20 took:
 40.6 seconds, i.e. 0.68 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A170753: 
a(n) = 0
truth: 
a(n) = 33*a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
