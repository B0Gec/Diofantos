avg sindy: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) - 93*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:25952/34371, seq_id:A192370, order:20 took:
 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A192370: 
a(n) = -160*a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 1) + -160*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 20, a(1) = 880

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
