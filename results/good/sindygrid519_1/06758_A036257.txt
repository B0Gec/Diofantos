avg sindy: 
a(n) = 297*a(n - 4) + 3676*a(n - 3) - 1687*a(n - 2) + 116*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

A036257: 
a(n) = 12500*a(n - 3) - 3125*a(n - 2) + 130*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 130*a(n - 1) + -3125*a(n - 2) + 12500*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 90, a(2) = 9700
