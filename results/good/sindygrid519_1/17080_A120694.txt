avg sindy: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 49*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:17081/34371, seq_id:A120694, order:20 took:
 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A120694: 
a(n) = -49*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 50*a(n - 1) + -49*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
