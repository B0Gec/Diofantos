avg sindy: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:26679/34371, seq_id:A201227, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A201227: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 219375, a(1) = 4566375, a(2) = 82569375

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
