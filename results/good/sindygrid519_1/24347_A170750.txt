avg sindy: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

 30.9 seconds, i.e. 0.52 minutes or 0.009 hours.

A170750: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
