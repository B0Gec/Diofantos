avg sindy: 
a(n) = 2228*a(n - 3) - 1118*a(n - 2) + 172*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

A152518: 
a(n) = 13365*a(n - 3) - 3051*a(n - 2) + 183*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 183*a(n - 1) + -3051*a(n - 2) + 13365*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 1290

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
