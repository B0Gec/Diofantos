avg sindy: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 2) + 98*a(n - 1)
False  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

A046190: 
a(n) = 0
truth: 
a(n) = 99*a(n - 1) + -99*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 63, a(2) = 6141

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
