avg sindy: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:8722/34371, seq_id:A041760, order:20 took:
 3.5 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A041760: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 20, a(1) = 801

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
