avg sindy: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:27694/34371, seq_id:A218749, order:20 took:
 6.5 seconds, i.e. 0.11 minutes or 0.002 hours.

A218749: 
a(n) = -46*a(n - 2) + 47*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 47*a(n - 1) + -46*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
