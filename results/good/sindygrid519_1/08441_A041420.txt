avg sindy: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:8442/34371, seq_id:A041420, order:20 took:
 4.3 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A041420: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 15, a(1) = 451

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
