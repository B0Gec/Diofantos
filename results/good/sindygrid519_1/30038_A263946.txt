avg sindy: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 3) - 22*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

A263946: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 51*a(n - 2) + 51*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 51*a(n - 1) + -51*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 26, a(1) = 2626, a(2) = 132522

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
