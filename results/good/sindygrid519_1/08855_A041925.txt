avg sindy: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:8856/34371, seq_id:A041925, order:20 took:
 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A041925: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 44*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 44

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
