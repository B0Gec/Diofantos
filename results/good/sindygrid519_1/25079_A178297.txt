avg sindy: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 4) + 200*a(n - 3) - 87*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

A178297: 
a(n) = 693*a(n - 3) - 239*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -239*a(n - 2) + 693*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 116

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
