avg sindy: 
a(n) = 12348*a(n - 3) - 2404*a(n - 2) + 118*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.

A145020: 
a(n) = 74088*a(n - 3) - 6468*a(n - 2) + 154*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 154*a(n - 1) + -6468*a(n - 2) + 74088*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 196, a(2) = 23716

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
