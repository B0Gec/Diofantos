avg sindy: 
a(n) = -14*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:20134/34371, seq_id:A156162, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A156162: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 625, a(1) = 18769, a(2) = 635209

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
