avg sindy: 
a(n) = 70*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:24798/34371, seq_id:A174773, order:20 took:
 19.3 seconds, i.e. 0.32 minutes or 0.005 hours.

A174773: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 70*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 70*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
