avg sindy: 
a(n) = 49*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:1386/34371, seq_id:A009976, order:20 took:
 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A009976: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
