avg sindy: 
a(n) = 69*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:1993/34371, seq_id:A013825, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A013825: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 16

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
