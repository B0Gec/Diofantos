avg sindy: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 1)
True  -  checked avg against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check avg if equation is correct.    
While total time consumed by now, scale:27693/34371, seq_id:A218748, order:20 took:
 3.8 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A218748: 
a(n) = -45*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 1) + -45*a(n - 2),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
