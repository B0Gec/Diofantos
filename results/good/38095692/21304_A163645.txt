 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163645: 
a(n) = -630*a(n - 5) + 35*a(n - 4) + 35*a(n - 3) + 35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + 35*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 3) + 35*a(n - 4) + -630*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 1332, a(3) = 47952, a(4) = 1726272

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
