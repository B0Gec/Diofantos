 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A099846: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 29

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
