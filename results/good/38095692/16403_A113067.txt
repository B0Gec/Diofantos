While total time consumed by now, scale:16404/34371, seq_id:A113067, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A113067: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = -11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
