 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A123115: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 40*a(n - 3) - 206*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 40*a(n - 1) + -206*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 96, a(3) = 3430

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
