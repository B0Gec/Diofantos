 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A293070: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
