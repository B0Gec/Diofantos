 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A253546: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 674*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 674*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 675*a(n - 1) + -675*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 547, a(2) = 368551

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
