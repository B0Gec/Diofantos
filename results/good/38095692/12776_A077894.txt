 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A077894: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
