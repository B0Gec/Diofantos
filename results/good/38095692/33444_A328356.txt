While total time consumed by now, scale:33445/34371, seq_id:A328356, order:20 took:
 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A328356: 
a(n) = 810*a(n - 7) - 99*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 810*a(n - 2) + 99*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 100*a(n - 1) + -909*a(n - 2) + 810*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 45, a(2) = 4500

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
