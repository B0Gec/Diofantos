 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074540: 
a(n) = 90*a(n - 4) + 17*a(n - 3) - 57*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -73*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 110

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
