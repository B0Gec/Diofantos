While total time consumed by now, scale:22450/34371, seq_id:A168052, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A168052: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
