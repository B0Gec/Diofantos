A159690: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 841, a(1) = 881, a(2) = 925, a(3) = 4121, a(4) = 4405, a(5) = 4709

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
