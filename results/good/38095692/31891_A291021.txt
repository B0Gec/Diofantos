 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291021: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 8) - 5*a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 67

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
