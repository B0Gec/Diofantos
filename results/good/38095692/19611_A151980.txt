While total time consumed by now, scale:19612/34371, seq_id:A151980, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A151980: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
