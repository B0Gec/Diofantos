While total time consumed by now, scale:26368/34371, seq_id:A198080, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A198080: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 27*a(n - 9) - 26*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 27*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -55*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 116

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
