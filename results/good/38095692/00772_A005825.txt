While total time consumed by now, scale:773/34371, seq_id:A005825, order:20 took:
 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A005825: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 31

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
