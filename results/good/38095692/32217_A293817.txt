A293817: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 26, a(4) = 37, a(5) = 62

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
