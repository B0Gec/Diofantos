While total time consumed by now, scale:22171/34371, seq_id:A167031, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A167031: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 20) - 20*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 64*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 337

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
