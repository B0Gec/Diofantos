 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064754: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 10) - 16*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 64*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -80*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 127, a(2) = 1535

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
