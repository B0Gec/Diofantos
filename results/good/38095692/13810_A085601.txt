While total time consumed by now, scale:13811/34371, seq_id:A085601, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A085601: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
