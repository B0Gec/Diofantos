 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A266975: 
a(n) = -100000*a(n - 3) + 10000*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 10000*a(n - 2) + -100000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 110, a(2) = 11100

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
