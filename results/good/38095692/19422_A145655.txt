While total time consumed by now, scale:19423/34371, seq_id:A145655, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A145655: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - 4*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 108

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
