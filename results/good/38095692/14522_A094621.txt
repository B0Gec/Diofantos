 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A094621: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 20) + a(n - 18) + 10*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 141

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
