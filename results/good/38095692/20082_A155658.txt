 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A155658: 
a(n) = 77*a(n - 4) - 18*a(n - 3) - 76*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -95*a(n - 2) + 77*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 169

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
