 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A151972: 
a(n) = -a(n - 17) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
