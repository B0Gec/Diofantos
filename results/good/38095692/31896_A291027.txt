While total time consumed by now, scale:31897/34371, seq_id:A291027, order:20 took:
 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291027: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 7*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 8*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 34, a(2) = 226, a(3) = 1501

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
