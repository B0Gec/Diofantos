While total time consumed by now, scale:3193/34371, seq_id:A016293, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016293: 
a(n) = 88*a(n - 5) + 14*a(n - 4) + 31*a(n - 3) - 58*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -74*a(n - 2) + 88*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 215

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
