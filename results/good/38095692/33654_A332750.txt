A332750: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 65, a(2) = 265, a(3) = 1005, a(4) = 3749, a(5) = 13927

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
