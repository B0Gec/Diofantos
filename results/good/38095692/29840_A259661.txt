 4.9 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A259661: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 10*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 10*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 110, a(3) = 1100

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
