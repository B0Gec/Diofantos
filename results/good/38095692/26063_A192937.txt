While total time consumed by now, scale:26064/34371, seq_id:A192937, order:20 took:
 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A192937: 
a(n) = 100*a(n - 14) - a(n - 13) - 100*a(n - 8) - 99*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 100*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 102*a(n - 1) + -201*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 100, a(1) = 9999, a(2) = 999898

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
