A143458: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 8) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 13, a(5) = 16, a(6) = 19, a(7) = 22

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
