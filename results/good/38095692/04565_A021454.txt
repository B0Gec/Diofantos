 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A021454: 
a(n) = -135*a(n - 5) + 87*a(n - 4) + 118*a(n - 3) - 86*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -104*a(n - 2) + 222*a(n - 3) + -135*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 220, a(3) = 2310

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
