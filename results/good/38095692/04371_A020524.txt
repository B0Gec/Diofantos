 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020524: 
a(n) = 256*a(n - 4) + 80*a(n - 3) - 150*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -176*a(n - 2) + 256*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 132

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
