While total time consumed by now, scale:30083/34371, seq_id:A265050, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A265050: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 39, a(5) = 68, a(6) = 114

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
