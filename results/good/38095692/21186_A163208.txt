 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163208: 
a(n) = -406*a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) + 28*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + 28*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + -406*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 870, a(3) = 25230

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
