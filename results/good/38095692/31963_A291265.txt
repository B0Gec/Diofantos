 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A291265: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 153

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
