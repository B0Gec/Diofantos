While total time consumed by now, scale:18651/34371, seq_id:A135918, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A135918: 
a(n) = 160*a(n - 16) - 28*a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - 160*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + -188*a(n - 2) + 160*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 81

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
