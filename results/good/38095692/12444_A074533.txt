While total time consumed by now, scale:12445/34371, seq_id:A074533, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A074533: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 33*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -44*a(n - 2) + 48*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 56

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
