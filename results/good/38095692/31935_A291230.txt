 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291230: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 6*a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 96, a(3) = 351, a(4) = 1242, a(5) = 4304

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
