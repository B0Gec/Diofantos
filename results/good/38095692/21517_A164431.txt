 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A164431: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 54, a(4) = 86, a(5) = 139

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
