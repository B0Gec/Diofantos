 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A290608: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
