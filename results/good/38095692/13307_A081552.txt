While total time consumed by now, scale:13308/34371, seq_id:A081552, order:20 took:
 5.0 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A081552: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - 10*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - 10*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
