 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020447: 
a(n) = 440*a(n - 3) - 183*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -183*a(n - 2) + 440*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 393

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
