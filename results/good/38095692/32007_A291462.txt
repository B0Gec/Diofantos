 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A291462: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 161

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
