 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A007750: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 16*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 16*a(n - 2) + -16*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 120

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
