 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A175714: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 13) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 10) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = -2, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
