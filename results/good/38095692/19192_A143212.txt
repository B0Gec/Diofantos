A143212: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 60

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
