While total time consumed by now, scale:24916/34371, seq_id:A176290, order:20 took:
 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A176290: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 4) - 17*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -75

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
