While total time consumed by now, scale:15219/34371, seq_id:A100052, order:20 took:
 4.4 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A100052: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 3, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
