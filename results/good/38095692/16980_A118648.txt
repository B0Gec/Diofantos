 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A118648: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 54, a(3) = 114, a(4) = 237

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
