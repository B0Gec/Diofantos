 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064751: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 6) - 10*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 25*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 49, a(2) = 374

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
