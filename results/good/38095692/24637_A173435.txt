While total time consumed by now, scale:24638/34371, seq_id:A173435, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A173435: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = -6, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
