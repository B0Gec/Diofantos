While total time consumed by now, scale:25399/34371, seq_id:A181718, order:20 took:
 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A181718: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 7) - 110*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 1122

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
