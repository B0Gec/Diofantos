 15.3 seconds, i.e. 0.26 minutes or 0.004 hours.

A287810: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
