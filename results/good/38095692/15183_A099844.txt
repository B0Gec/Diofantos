A099844: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 24, a(5) = 48

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
