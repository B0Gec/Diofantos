 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A155664: 
a(n) = 80*a(n - 7) - 18*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 80*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -98*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 163

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
