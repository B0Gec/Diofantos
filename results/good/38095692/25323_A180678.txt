 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A180678: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
