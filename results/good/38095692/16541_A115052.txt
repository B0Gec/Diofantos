While total time consumed by now, scale:16542/34371, seq_id:A115052, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A115052: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 54

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
