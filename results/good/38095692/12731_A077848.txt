 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A077848: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
