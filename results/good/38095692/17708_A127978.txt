 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A127978: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 11) - 3*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 31

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
