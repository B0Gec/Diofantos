 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291395: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 4) - 12*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -12*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 103, a(3) = 425

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
