 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A263946: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 50*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 51*a(n - 1) + -51*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 26, a(1) = 2626, a(2) = 132522

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
