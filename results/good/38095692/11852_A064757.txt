While total time consumed by now, scale:11853/34371, seq_id:A064757, order:20 took:
 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064757: 
a(n) = 121*a(n - 8) - 22*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 121*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -143*a(n - 2) + 121*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 241, a(2) = 3992

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
