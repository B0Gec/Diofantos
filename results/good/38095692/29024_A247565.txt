 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A247565: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
