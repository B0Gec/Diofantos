A028196: 
a(n) = -4950*a(n - 4) + 2485*a(n - 3) - 449*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 35*a(n - 1) + -449*a(n - 2) + 2485*a(n - 3) + -4950*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 776, a(3) = 13930

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
