While total time consumed by now, scale:17379/34371, seq_id:A123304, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A123304: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 15) - 3*a(n - 14) - 6*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 263

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
