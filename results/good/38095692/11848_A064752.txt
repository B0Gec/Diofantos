 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064752: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 9) - 12*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - 36*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 71, a(2) = 647

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
