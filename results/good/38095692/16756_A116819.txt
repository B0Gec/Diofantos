While total time consumed by now, scale:16757/34371, seq_id:A116819, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A116819: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
