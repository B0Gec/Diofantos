 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A131589: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -3, a(1) = 3, a(2) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
