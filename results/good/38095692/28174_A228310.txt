 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A228310: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 72, a(2) = 448

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
