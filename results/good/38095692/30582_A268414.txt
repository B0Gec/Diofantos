 3.7 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A268414: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 13) - a(n - 12) - 5*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 5*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
