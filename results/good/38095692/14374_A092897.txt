 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A092897: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
