While total time consumed by now, scale:31555/34371, seq_id:A288038, order:20 took:
 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A288038: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 17) - 3*a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 33

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
