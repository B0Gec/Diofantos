 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A085354: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
