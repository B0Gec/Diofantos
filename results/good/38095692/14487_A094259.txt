While total time consumed by now, scale:14488/34371, seq_id:A094259, order:20 took:
 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A094259: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 6*a(n - 11) - 5*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
