 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A160016: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 2019, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 6, a(6) = 8, a(7) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
