While total time consumed by now, scale:19108/34371, seq_id:A141291, order:20 took:
 3.3 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A141291: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 4*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 4*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
