While total time consumed by now, scale:20117/34371, seq_id:A156002, order:20 took:
 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A156002: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - 7*a(n - 10) - 6*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 44, a(4) = 311

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
