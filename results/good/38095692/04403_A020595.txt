 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020595: 
a(n) = 540*a(n - 3) - 204*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -204*a(n - 2) + 540*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 421

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
