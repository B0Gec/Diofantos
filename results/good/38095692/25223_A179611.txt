While total time consumed by now, scale:25224/34371, seq_id:A179611, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A179611: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
