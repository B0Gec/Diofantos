While total time consumed by now, scale:28694/34371, seq_id:A241271, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A241271: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
