While total time consumed by now, scale:11847/34371, seq_id:A064750, order:20 took:
 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A064750: 
a(n) = 144*a(n - 20) - 24*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 144*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -168*a(n - 2) + 144*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 289

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
