 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A126644: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 58

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
