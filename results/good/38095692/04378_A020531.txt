While total time consumed by now, scale:4379/34371, seq_id:A020531, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A020531: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 19) - 20*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 64*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 305

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
