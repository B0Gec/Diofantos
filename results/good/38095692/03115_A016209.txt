While total time consumed by now, scale:3116/34371, seq_id:A016209, order:20 took:
 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016209: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 19) - 8*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 15*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 58

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
