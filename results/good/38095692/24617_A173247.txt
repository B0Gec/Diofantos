While total time consumed by now, scale:24618/34371, seq_id:A173247, order:20 took:
 3.6 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A173247: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 13) + a(n - 11) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = -7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
