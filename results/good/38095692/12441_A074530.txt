 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A074530: 
a(n) = 48*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 33*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -46*a(n - 2) + 48*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 77

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
