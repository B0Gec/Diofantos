 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A007698: 
a(n) = -11*a(n - 4) + 18*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 219, a(2) = 4796, a(3) = 105030

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
