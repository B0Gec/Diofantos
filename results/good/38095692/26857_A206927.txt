A206927: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 37, a(5) = 75, a(6) = 150

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
