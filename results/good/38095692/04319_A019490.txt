 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A019490: 
a(n) = 288*a(n - 3) - 144*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -144*a(n - 2) + 288*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 340

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
