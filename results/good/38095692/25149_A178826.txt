While total time consumed by now, scale:25150/34371, seq_id:A178826, order:20 took:
 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A178826: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - 7*a(n - 7) - 6*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 309, a(4) = 2176

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
