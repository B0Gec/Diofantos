While total time consumed by now, scale:13840/34371, seq_id:A086090, order:20 took:
 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A086090: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
