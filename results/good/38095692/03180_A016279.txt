 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016279: 
a(n) = 60*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 41*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 60*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 169

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
