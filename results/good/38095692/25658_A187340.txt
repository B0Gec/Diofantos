While total time consumed by now, scale:25659/34371, seq_id:A187340, order:20 took:
 3.8 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A187340: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
