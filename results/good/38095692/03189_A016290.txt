 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016290: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 42*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -56*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 140

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
