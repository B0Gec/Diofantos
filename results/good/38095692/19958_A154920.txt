While total time consumed by now, scale:19959/34371, seq_id:A154920, order:20 took:
 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A154920: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 8) - 3*a(n - 6) - 16*a(n - 5) - 41*a(n - 4) - 38*a(n - 3) + 14*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 18*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 324

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
