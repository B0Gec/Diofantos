 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A126718: 
a(n) = -24*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 6) + 17*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 43, a(2) = 235, a(3) = 1171

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
