A028223: 
a(n) = -6720*a(n - 4) + 3032*a(n - 3) - 506*a(n - 2) + 37*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 37*a(n - 1) + -506*a(n - 2) + 3032*a(n - 3) + -6720*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 863, a(3) = 16241

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
