 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016307: 
a(n) = 120*a(n - 3) - 92*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -92*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 232

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
