While total time consumed by now, scale:32996/34371, seq_id:A308807, order:20 took:
 4.4 seconds, i.e. 0.07 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A308807: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - 5*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) - 5*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 103

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
