 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A027085: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) - 2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 39, a(3) = 84, a(4) = 169

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
