 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A201200: 
a(n) = 44*a(n - 4) + 64*a(n - 3) - 68*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -68*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + 44*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 256

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
