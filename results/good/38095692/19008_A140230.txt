While total time consumed by now, scale:19009/34371, seq_id:A140230, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A140230: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 7) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 2, a(3) = -6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
