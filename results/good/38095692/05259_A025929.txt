 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A025929: 
a(n) = -288*a(n - 5) + 48*a(n - 4) + 202*a(n - 3) - 113*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -134*a(n - 2) + 336*a(n - 3) + -288*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 307, a(3) = 3969

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
