 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A163829: 
a(n) = -1081*a(n - 5) + 46*a(n - 4) + 46*a(n - 3) + 46*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 46*a(n - 1) + 46*a(n - 2) + 46*a(n - 3) + 46*a(n - 4) + -1081*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 2256, a(3) = 106032, a(4) = 4983504

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
