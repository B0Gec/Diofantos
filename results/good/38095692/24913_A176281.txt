 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A176281: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) - 8*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
