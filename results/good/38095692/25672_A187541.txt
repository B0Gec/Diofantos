 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A187541: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 20, a(6) = 3, a(7) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
