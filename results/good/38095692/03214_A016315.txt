 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016315: 
a(n) = 168*a(n - 4) + 46*a(n - 3) - 101*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -122*a(n - 2) + 168*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 319

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
