While total time consumed by now, scale:16317/34371, seq_id:A111640, order:20 took:
 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

A111640: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) - 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -9, a(2) = 45, a(3) = -195

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
