 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A016326: 
a(n) = 240*a(n - 4) + 76*a(n - 3) - 140*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -164*a(n - 2) + 240*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 412

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
