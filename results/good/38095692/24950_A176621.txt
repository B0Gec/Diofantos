 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A176621: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 11*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 40, a(5) = 157

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
