A262492: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 102*a(n - 4) + 100
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 102*a(n - 4) + -102*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 25, a(1) = 90, a(2) = 207, a(3) = 1117, a(4) = 2560, a(5) = 9255, a(6) = 21202, a(7) = 114022, a(8) = 261195

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
