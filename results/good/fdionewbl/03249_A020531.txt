 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A020531: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1) + 45
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 305

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
