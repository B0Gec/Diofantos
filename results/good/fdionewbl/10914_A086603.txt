 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A086603: 
a(n) = -81*a(n - 4) + 108*a(n - 3) - 54*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -54*a(n - 2) + 108*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 243

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
