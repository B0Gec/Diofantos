 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A102341: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) + 54*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 54*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 120, a(2) = 1848, a(3) = 25080

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
