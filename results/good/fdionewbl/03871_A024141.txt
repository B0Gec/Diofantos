 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A024141: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) + 11
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -25*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 142

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
