 3.6 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A254874: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 5
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 31, a(5) = 49, a(6) = 73

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
