 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A051588: 
a(n) = -960*a(n - 4) + 712*a(n - 3) - 194*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -194*a(n - 2) + 712*a(n - 3) + -960*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 175

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
