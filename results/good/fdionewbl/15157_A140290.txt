 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A140290: 
a(n) = -15*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) - 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -15*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -4

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
