by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A266506: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 3, a(6) = 3, a(7) = 5

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
