 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A334909: 
a(n) = -1024*a(n - 4) + 960*a(n - 3) - 280*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -280*a(n - 2) + 960*a(n - 3) + -1024*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 770, a(3) = 14260

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
