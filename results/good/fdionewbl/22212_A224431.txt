 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A224431: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 4) + 96*a(n - 3) - 52*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1) - 126
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -64*a(n - 2) + 148*a(n - 3) + -160*a(n - 4) + 64*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 224, a(1) = 4878, a(2) = 46250, a(3) = 322146, a(4) = 1914578

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
