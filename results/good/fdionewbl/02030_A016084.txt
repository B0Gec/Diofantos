 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A016084: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 1) + 9
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
