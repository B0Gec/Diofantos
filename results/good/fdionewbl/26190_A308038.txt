A308038: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) + 22
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 34, a(5) = 57, a(6) = 134, a(7) = 196, a(8) = 370

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
