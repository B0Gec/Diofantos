 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A128988: 
a(n) = -625*a(n - 4) + 500*a(n - 3) - 150*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -150*a(n - 2) + 500*a(n - 3) + -625*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 100, a(2) = 2250, a(3) = 30000

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
