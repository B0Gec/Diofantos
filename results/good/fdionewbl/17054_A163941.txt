 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A163941: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 52, a(3) = 246

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
