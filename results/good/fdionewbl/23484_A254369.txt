 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A254369: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) - 210
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 56, a(1) = 84, a(2) = 156, a(3) = 354

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
