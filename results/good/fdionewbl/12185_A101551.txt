 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A101551: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
