A041109: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 126*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 126*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 119, a(5) = 127, a(6) = 881, a(7) = 1008

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
