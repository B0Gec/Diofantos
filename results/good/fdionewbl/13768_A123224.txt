 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A123224: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1) - 7
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 428

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
