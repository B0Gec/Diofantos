 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021268: 
a(n) = 160*a(n - 3) - 116*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -136*a(n - 2) + 276*a(n - 3) + -160*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 305, a(3) = 3825

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
