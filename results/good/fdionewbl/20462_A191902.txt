 3.9 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A191902: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 120
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -9*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 121, a(3) = 512, a(4) = 1562, a(5) = 3888, a(6) = 8403

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
