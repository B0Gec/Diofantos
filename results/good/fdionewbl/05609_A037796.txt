 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A037796: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 162, a(3) = 1134, a(4) = 7941

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
