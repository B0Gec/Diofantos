by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A206454: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 64, a(2) = 512, a(3) = 4096, a(4) = 32768, a(5) = 262144, a(6) = 2097152, a(7) = 16777215

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
