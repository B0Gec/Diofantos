 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A164443: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - 5
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 64, a(4) = 110, a(5) = 190

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
