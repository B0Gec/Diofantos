 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A047495: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
