 3.6 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A238823: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 34, a(5) = 84, a(6) = 208

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
