 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A037503: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 102, a(3) = 1021

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
