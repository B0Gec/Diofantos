 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A215500: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 14

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
