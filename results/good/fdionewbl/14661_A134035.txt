 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A134035: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) - 8*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 2) - 4
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + -3*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 21, a(5) = 39, a(6) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
