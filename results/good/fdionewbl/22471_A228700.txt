 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A228700: 
a(n) = -384*a(n - 4) + 400*a(n - 3) - 140*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -140*a(n - 2) + 400*a(n - 3) + -384*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 8

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
