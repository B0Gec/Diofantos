 4.5 seconds, i.e. 0.08 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A123518: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 166, a(4) = 671, a(5) = 2602

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
