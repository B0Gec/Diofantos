 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A121486: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + 15*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 43, a(5) = 132, a(6) = 400

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
