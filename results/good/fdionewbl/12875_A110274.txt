 2.4 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A110274: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 19
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 16, a(1) = 135, a(2) = 1010, a(3) = 7528, a(4) = 56183

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
