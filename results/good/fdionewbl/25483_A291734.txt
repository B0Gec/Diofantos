 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A291734: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 18, a(3) = 45, a(4) = 108, a(5) = 258

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
