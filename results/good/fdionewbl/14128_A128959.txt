 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A128959: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) - 18
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 5) + -10*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 82, a(1) = 810, a(2) = 8096, a(3) = 80953, a(4) = 809524, a(5) = 8095239

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
