 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021079: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 3) - 50*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 106*a(n - 3) + -56*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 133, a(3) = 1086

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
