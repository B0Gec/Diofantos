While total time consumed by now, scale:12763/27236, seq_id:A109045, order:20 took:
 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A109045: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1) + 44
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 20, a(6) = 12, a(7) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
