 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A024090: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) + 14
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 60, a(3) = 503

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
