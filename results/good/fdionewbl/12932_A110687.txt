 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A110687: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 5) - 12*a(n - 4) - 20*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) - 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -8, a(2) = 28, a(3) = -100, a(4) = 358

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
