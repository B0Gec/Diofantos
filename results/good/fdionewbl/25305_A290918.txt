 3.2 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A290918: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) - 30*a(n - 4) + 45*a(n - 3) - 30*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 45*a(n - 3) + -30*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 147, a(4) = 486, a(5) = 1566

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
