 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A003472: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 5) - 80*a(n - 4) + 80*a(n - 3) - 40*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -40*a(n - 2) + 80*a(n - 3) + -80*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 60, a(3) = 280, a(4) = 1120

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
