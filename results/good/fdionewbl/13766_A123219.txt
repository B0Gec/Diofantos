 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A123219: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 28*a(n - 3) + 202*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 1) - 96
truth: 
a(n) = 29*a(n - 1) + 174*a(n - 2) + -174*a(n - 3) + -29*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 81, a(3) = 2401, a(4) = 83521

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
