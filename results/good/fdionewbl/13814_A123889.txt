While total time consumed by now, scale:13815/27236, seq_id:A123889, order:20 took:
 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A123889: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 58, a(4) = 208, a(5) = 740, a(6) = 2628

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
