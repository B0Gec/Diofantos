 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A334706: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 24
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 44, a(4) = 84, a(5) = 140, a(6) = 224

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
