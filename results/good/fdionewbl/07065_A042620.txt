A042620: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 1680*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1680*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 28, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 811, a(3) = 840, a(4) = 47851, a(5) = 48691, a(6) = 1362508, a(7) = 1411199

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
