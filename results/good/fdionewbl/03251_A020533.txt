 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A020533: 
a(n) = 4096*a(n - 3) - 1344*a(n - 2) + 84*a(n - 1) - 2835
truth: 
a(n) = 85*a(n - 1) + -1428*a(n - 2) + 5440*a(n - 3) + -4096*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 169, a(2) = 5473, a(3) = 283009

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
