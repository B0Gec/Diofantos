 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A077122: 
a(n) = -32*a(n - 4) + 64*a(n - 3) - 42*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) + 12
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -53*a(n - 2) + 106*a(n - 3) + -96*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 56, a(3) = 460, a(4) = 2976

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
