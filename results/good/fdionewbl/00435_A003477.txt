 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A003477: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 33, a(5) = 71

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
