by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A070382: 
a(n) = 34 - a(n - 8)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 23, a(4) = 13, a(5) = 31, a(6) = 19, a(7) = 27, a(8) = 33

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
