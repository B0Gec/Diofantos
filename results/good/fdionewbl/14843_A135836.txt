 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A135836: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 13
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 82, a(3) = 254, a(4) = 677

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
