 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A291392: 
a(n) = -36*a(n - 4) - 72*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + -72*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 90, a(3) = 765

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
