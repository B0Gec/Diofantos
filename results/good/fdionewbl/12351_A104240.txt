A104240: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 1298*a(n - 3) + 648
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1298*a(n - 3) + -1298*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 144, a(3) = 504, a(4) = 9727, a(5) = 187560, a(6) = 654840

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
