While total time consumed by now, scale:15344/27236, seq_id:A143662, order:20 took:
 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A143662: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 0, a(6) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
