 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A074826: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 15*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 6

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
