 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A195160: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 9
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 25

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
