 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A263622: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
