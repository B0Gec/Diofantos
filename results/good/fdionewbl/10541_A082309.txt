 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A082309: 
a(n) = -576*a(n - 4) + 480*a(n - 3) - 148*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -148*a(n - 2) + 480*a(n - 3) + -576*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 218

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
