 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A131557: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 322*a(n - 2) - 680
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 322*a(n - 2) + -322*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 55, a(1) = 2485, a(2) = 17020, a(3) = 799480, a(4) = 5479705

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
