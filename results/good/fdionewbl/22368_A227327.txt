 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A227327: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 22, a(5) = 41, a(6) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
