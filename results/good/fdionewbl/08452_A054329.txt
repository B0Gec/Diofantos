 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A054329: 
a(n) = -256*a(n - 4) + 256*a(n - 3) - 96*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -96*a(n - 2) + 256*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 224, a(3) = 1920

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
