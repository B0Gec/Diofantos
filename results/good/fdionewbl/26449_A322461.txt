 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A322461: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) - 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = -8, a(2) = 54

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
