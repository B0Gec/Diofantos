 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A291038: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 84, a(4) = 216, a(5) = 544

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
