by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A117476: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 2) + 46
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 33, a(2) = 133, a(3) = 252, a(4) = 832

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
