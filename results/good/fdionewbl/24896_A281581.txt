 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A281581: 
a(n) = -240*a(n - 4) + 268*a(n - 3) - 104*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -104*a(n - 2) + 268*a(n - 3) + -240*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 127

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
