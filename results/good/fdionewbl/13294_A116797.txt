 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A116797: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 241

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
