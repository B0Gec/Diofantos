by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A164492: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 56, a(4) = 93, a(5) = 155, a(6) = 259

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
