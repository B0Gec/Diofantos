 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A281362: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
