 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A027651: 
a(n) = -120*a(n - 4) + 154*a(n - 3) - 71*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -71*a(n - 2) + 154*a(n - 3) + -120*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 146, a(3) = 1066

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
