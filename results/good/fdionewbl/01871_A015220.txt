 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 9. 
A015220: 
a(n) = a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 3) + 64
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9) + -1*a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 20, a(4) = 56, a(5) = 84, a(6) = 120, a(7) = 220, a(8) = 286, a(9) = 364

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
