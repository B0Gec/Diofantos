by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A287497: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 53, a(4) = 166, a(5) = 432

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
