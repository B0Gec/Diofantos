 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A083588: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 3) - 33*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -43*a(n - 2) + 69*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 71

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
