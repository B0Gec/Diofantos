 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A291245: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 120, a(3) = 599

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
