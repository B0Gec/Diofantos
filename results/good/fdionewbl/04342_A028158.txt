 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A028158: 
a(n) = -3520*a(n - 4) + 1992*a(n - 3) - 394*a(n - 2) + 33*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 33*a(n - 1) + -394*a(n - 2) + 1992*a(n - 3) + -3520*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 33, a(2) = 695, a(3) = 11925

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
