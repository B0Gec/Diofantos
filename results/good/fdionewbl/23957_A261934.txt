A261934: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 18*a(n - 4) + 72
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 18*a(n - 4) + -18*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 52, a(4) = 205, a(5) = 383, a(6) = 544, a(7) = 1010, a(8) = 3755

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
