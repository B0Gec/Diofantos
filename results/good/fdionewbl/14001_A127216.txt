 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A127216: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 56, a(3) = 240

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
