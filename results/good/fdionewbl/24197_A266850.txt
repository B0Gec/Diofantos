 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A266850: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 5) - 64*a(n - 4) + 20*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1) - 45
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 21*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -84*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 64*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 123, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 2031

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
