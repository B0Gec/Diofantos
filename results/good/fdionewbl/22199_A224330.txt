 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A224330: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 3) - 48*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) - 25
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -61*a(n - 2) + 84*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 213, a(3) = 1724

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
