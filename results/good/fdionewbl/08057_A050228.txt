 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A050228: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 11, a(4) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
