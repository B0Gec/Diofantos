 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A025930: 
a(n) = -180*a(n - 4) + 216*a(n - 3) - 91*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -91*a(n - 2) + 216*a(n - 3) + -180*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 165, a(3) = 1400

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
