 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A137797: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1) + 30
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = -2, a(5) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
