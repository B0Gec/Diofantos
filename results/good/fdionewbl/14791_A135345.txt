 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A135345: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 204

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
