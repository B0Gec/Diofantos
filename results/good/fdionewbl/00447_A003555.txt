 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A003555: 
a(n) = -1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1) - 44
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 66, a(2) = 6216

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
