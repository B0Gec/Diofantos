 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A054322: 
a(n) = -256*a(n - 4) + 256*a(n - 3) - 96*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -96*a(n - 2) + 256*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 80, a(2) = 896, a(3) = 7680

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
