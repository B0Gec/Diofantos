 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A309717: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 28

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
