 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A136305: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 20

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
