 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A191821: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 5) - 28*a(n - 4) + 38*a(n - 3) - 25*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 63*a(n - 3) + -66*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 5) + -8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 100, a(4) = 332, a(5) = 994

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
