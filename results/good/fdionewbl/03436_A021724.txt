 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021724: 
a(n) = 360*a(n - 3) - 186*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -211*a(n - 2) + 546*a(n - 3) + -360*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 465, a(3) = 7150

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
