 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A049779: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 23, a(4) = 41, a(5) = 62

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
