 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A060548: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 2

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
