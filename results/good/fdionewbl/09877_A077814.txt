 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A077814: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
