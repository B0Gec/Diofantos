 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021514: 
a(n) = 180*a(n - 3) - 108*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -127*a(n - 2) + 288*a(n - 3) + -180*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 273, a(3) = 3208

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
