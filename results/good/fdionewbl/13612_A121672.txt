 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A121672: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 120
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -4, a(2) = -38, a(3) = -12, a(4) = 404, a(5) = 1900

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
