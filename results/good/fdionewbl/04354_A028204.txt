by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A028204: 
a(n) = -3780*a(n - 4) + 1968*a(n - 3) - 379*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 1) + -379*a(n - 2) + 1968*a(n - 3) + -3780*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 645, a(3) = 10480

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
