 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A213036: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 3) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 12, a(5) = 16, a(6) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
