 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A181305: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) + 12*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 24, a(4) = 104

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
