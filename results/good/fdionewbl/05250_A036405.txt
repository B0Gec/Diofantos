 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A036405: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -2*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 4, a(6) = 6, a(7) = 7, a(8) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
