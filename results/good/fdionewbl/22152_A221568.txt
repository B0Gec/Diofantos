 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A221568: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 100

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
