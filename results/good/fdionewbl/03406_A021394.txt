 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021394: 
a(n) = 132*a(n - 3) - 89*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -107*a(n - 2) + 221*a(n - 3) + -132*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 254, a(3) = 3014

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
