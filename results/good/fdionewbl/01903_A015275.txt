 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A015275: 
a(n) = 117649*a(n - 3) + 14749*a(n - 2) - 301*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = -300*a(n - 1) + 15050*a(n - 2) + 102900*a(n - 3) + -117649*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -300, a(2) = 105050, a(3) = -35927100

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
