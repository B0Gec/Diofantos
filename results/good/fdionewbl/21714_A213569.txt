 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A213569: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 3) - 8*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 71

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
