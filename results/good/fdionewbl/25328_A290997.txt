 2.2 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A290997: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) - 18*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 12

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
