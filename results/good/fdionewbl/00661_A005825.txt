 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A005825: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 31

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
