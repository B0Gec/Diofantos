 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A110935: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
