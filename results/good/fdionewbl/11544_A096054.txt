 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A096054: 
a(n) = 1296*a(n - 3) - 504*a(n - 2) + 49*a(n - 1) - 420
truth: 
a(n) = 50*a(n - 1) + -553*a(n - 2) + 1800*a(n - 3) + -1296*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 91, a(2) = 3751, a(3) = 138811

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
