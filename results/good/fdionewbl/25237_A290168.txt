 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A290168: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 12, a(5) = 15, a(6) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
