by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A110611: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
