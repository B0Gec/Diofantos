 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A292489: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 60, a(3) = 312

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
