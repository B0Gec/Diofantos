 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A037698: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 66, a(3) = 462, a(4) = 3235

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
