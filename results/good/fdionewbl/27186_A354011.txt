 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A354011: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 81, a(5) = 184

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
