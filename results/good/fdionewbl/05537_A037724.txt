 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A037724: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 53, a(3) = 266, a(4) = 1332

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
