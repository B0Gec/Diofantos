A033439: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7) + -2*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 10, a(6) = 15, a(7) = 21, a(8) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
