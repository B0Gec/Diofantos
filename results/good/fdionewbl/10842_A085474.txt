 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A085474: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 32
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 69, a(3) = 195

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
