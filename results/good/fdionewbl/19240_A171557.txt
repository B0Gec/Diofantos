 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A171557: 
a(n) = -81*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = -9, a(3) = -81

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
