 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A025933: 
a(n) = -270*a(n - 4) + 309*a(n - 3) - 121*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -121*a(n - 2) + 309*a(n - 3) + -270*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 240, a(3) = 2570

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
