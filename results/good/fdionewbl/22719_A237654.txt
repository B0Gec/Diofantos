 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A237654: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 25

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
