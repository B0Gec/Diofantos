 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A208903: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 4) - 8*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 32, a(4) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
