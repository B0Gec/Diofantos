While total time consumed by now, scale:26933/27236, seq_id:A342131, order:20 took:
 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A342131: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 1) + 9
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
