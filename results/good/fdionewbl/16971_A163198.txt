 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A163198: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) - 56*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -77*a(n - 2) + 77*a(n - 3) + -22*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 28, a(3) = 540, a(4) = 9801

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
