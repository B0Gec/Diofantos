by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A036499: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 12
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
