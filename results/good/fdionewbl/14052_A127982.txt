 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A127982: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 57, a(4) = 147

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
