 7.0 seconds, i.e. 0.12 minutes or 0.002 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A211068: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) + 72
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6) + -4*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8) + 1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 144, a(5) = 243, a(6) = 528, a(7) = 768, a(8) = 1400

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
