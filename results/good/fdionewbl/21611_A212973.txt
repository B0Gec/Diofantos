 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A212973: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 50, a(5) = 84

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
