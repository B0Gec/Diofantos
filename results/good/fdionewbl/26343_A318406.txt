 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A318406: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 7

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
