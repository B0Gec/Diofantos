 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A214993: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 11, a(1) = 121, a(2) = 1341

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
