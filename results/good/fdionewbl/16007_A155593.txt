 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A155593: 
a(n) = -18*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 84

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
