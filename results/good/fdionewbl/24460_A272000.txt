 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A272000: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 47, a(4) = 79, a(5) = 111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
