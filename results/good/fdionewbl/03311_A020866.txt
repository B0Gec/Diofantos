 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A020866: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 41, a(1) = 265, a(2) = 1697, a(3) = 10897

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
