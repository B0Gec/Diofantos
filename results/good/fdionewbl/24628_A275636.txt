 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A275636: 
a(n) = -27*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 16

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
