 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A074048: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 15

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
