 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A291242: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 35, a(4) = 91, a(5) = 241

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
