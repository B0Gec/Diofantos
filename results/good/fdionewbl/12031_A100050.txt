 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A100050: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 0

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
