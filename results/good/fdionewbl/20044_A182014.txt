by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A182014: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 44*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + -44*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 29, a(2) = 477, a(3) = 8303, a(4) = 143697

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
