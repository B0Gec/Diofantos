 2.6 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A115217: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 30, a(5) = 62

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
