 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A209547: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) + 10*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 20*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 20, a(1) = 105, a(2) = 562, a(3) = 3051, a(4) = 16582, a(5) = 90186

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
