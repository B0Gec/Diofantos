 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A127620: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 5) - 28*a(n - 4) - 24*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -24*a(n - 3) + -28*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 117, a(5) = 654

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
