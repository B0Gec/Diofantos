 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A335649: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 18*a(n - 3) - 58*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1) + 20
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -76*a(n - 2) + 76*a(n - 3) + -19*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 200, a(3) = 3040, a(4) = 43320

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
