 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A121800: 
a(n) = 56*a(n - 6) + 80*a(n - 5) - 60*a(n - 4) - 48*a(n - 3) + 18*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 18*a(n - 2) + -48*a(n - 3) + -60*a(n - 4) + 80*a(n - 5) + 56*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 159, a(2) = 4694, a(3) = 36506, a(4) = 190224, a(5) = 1152620

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
