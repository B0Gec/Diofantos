 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A229834: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 11, a(4) = -2, a(5) = 26, a(6) = -10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
