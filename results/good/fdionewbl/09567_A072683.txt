by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A072683: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 60
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 26, a(4) = 44, a(5) = 46, a(6) = 47, a(7) = 53, a(8) = 64

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
