 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A123480: 
a(n) = -a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 60, a(2) = 840

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
