 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A178826: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 7*a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 309, a(4) = 2176

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
