 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A232602: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 4) - 32*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) - 8*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 30, a(3) = -186, a(4) = 838

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
