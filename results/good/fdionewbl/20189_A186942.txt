 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A186942: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 3) - 20*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -28*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 79

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
