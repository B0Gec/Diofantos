 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A173690: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 11, a(6) = 18, a(7) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
