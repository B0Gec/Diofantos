 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A155633: 
a(n) = -30*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) - 20
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -41*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 60

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
