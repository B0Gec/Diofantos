 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A213393: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1) + 48
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 54, a(4) = 108, a(5) = 192, a(6) = 300, a(7) = 450

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
