 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021924: 
a(n) = 352*a(n - 3) - 164*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 1) + -187*a(n - 2) + 516*a(n - 3) + -352*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 389, a(3) = 5364

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
