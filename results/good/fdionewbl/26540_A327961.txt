 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A327961: 
a(n) = -256*a(n - 4) + 288*a(n - 3) - 112*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -112*a(n - 2) + 288*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 122

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
