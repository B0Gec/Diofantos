 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A081663: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 25

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
