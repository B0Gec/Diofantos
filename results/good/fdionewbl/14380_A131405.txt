 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A131405: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
