by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A130647: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3) + 1678
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 60, a(2) = 2241, a(3) = 2517, a(4) = 2821, a(5) = 15180, a(6) = 16780

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
