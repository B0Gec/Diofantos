 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A191903: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 24
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 128, a(4) = 312, a(5) = 648

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
