 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A024103: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) + 16
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 28*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 77, a(3) = 720

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
