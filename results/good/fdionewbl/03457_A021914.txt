 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021914: 
a(n) = 320*a(n - 3) - 152*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -174*a(n - 2) + 472*a(n - 3) + -320*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 355, a(3) = 4635

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
