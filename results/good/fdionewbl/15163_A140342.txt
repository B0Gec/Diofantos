 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A140342: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) + 13*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
