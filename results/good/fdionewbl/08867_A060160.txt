 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A060160: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1) - 5
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 79

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
