by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A257940: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 322*a(n - 2) + 32
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 322*a(n - 2) + -322*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 52, a(3) = 357, a(4) = 16776

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
