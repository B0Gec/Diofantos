 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021048: 
a(n) = 54*a(n - 3) - 51*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -65*a(n - 2) + 105*a(n - 3) + -54*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 160, a(3) = 1530

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
