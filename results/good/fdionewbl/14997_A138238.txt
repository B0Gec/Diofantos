 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A138238: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
