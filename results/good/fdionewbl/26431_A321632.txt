 0.8 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A321632: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = -1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
