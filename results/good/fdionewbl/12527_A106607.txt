 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A106607: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 13, a(6) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
