 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A302488: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
