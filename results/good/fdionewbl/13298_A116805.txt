 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A116805: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - 10*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 3) - 17*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 36*a(n - 3) + -29*a(n - 4) + 12*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 74, a(5) = 256

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
