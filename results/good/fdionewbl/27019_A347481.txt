 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A347481: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) - 6
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 54, a(4) = 104, a(5) = 205

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
