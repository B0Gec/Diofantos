by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A164496: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 58, a(4) = 96, a(5) = 159

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
