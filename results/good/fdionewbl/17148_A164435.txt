by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A164435: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 62, a(4) = 104, a(5) = 175, a(6) = 295

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
