 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A213785: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 113

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
