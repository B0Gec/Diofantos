While total time consumed by now, scale:21726/27236, seq_id:A213586, order:20 took:
 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A213586: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 4
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 112

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
