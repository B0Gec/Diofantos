by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A253673: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 98*a(n - 2) - 48
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 98*a(n - 2) + -98*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 1520, a(4) = 6321

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
