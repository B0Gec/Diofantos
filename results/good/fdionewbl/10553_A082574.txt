 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A082574: 
a(n) = a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
