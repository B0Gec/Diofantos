 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A123282: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 208*a(n - 3) - 2718*a(n - 2) + 208*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 208*a(n - 1) + -2718*a(n - 2) + 208*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 2744, a(3) = 527280

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
