 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A060352: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) - 4
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 80

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
