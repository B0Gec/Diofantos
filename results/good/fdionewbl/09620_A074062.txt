 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A074062: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = -1, a(2) = -1, a(3) = -1, a(4) = -1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
