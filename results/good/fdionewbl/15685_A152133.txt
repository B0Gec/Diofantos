 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A152133: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1) + 8
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 38, a(3) = 78, a(4) = 136

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
