 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A045624: 
a(n) = -272*a(n - 4) + 272*a(n - 3) - 102*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -102*a(n - 2) + 272*a(n - 3) + -272*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 101, a(3) = 851

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
