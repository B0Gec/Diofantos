by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A136429: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 10*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 26, a(4) = 84, a(5) = 250

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
