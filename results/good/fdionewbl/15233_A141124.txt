 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A141124: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = -9, a(3) = -9

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
