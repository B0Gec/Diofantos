 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A328683: 
a(n) = 100*a(n - 3) - 120*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1) - 729
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -141*a(n - 2) + 220*a(n - 3) + -100*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 81, a(1) = 1782, a(2) = 26973, a(3) = 359964

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
