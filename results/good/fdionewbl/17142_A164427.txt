 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A164427: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 63, a(4) = 105

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
