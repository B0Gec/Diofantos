 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A272144: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
