 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A074503: 
a(n) = -14*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 54

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
