 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A244864: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3) + -15*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 49, a(3) = 165, a(4) = 440, a(5) = 1001

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
