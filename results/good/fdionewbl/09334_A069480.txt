 3.2 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A069480: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = -5, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 13, a(5) = -12

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
