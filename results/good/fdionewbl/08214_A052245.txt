 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A052245: 
a(n) = -100*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -120*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 210

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
