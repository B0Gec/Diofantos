by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A129993: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3) + 398
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 504, a(3) = 597, a(4) = 704, a(5) = 3441, a(6) = 3980

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
