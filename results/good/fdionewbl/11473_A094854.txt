 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A094854: 
a(n) = a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
