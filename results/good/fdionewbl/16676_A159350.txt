 2.1 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A159350: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 11

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
