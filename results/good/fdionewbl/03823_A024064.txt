 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A024064: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 207

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
