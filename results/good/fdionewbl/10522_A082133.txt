 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A082133: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
