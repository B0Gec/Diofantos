 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A284647: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) - 23*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -33*a(n - 2) + 33*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 36, a(4) = 231

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
