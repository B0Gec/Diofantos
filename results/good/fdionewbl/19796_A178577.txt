 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A178577: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4) + -5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 18, a(4) = 87

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
