 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A097551: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 37, a(4) = 101

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
