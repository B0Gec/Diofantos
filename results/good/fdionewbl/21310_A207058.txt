by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A207058: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3) + 526
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 145, a(2) = 364, a(3) = 789, a(4) = 1564, a(5) = 2805, a(6) = 5260

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
