 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A117616: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
