 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A131412: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 32, a(5) = 62

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
