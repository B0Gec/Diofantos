 2.5 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A266610: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) + 16*a(n - 4) + 15*a(n - 3) + 15*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1) + 450
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 16*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -16*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 100, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 2040

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
