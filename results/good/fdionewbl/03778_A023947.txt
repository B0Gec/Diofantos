 1.4 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A023947: 
a(n) = 600*a(n - 3) - 230*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 28*a(n - 1) + -257*a(n - 2) + 830*a(n - 3) + -600*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 28, a(2) = 527, a(3) = 8390

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
