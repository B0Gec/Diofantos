 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A346375: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 9
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 92

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
