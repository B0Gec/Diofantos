 2.0 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A161762: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 12

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
