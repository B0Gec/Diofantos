 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A188530: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) - 3
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 107

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
