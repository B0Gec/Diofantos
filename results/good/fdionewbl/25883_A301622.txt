 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A301622: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 90
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 49, a(3) = 67, a(4) = 103

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
