 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A037788: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 120, a(3) = 721

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
