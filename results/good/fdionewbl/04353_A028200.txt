 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A028200: 
a(n) = -3024*a(n - 4) + 1650*a(n - 3) - 335*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -335*a(n - 2) + 1650*a(n - 3) + -3024*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 565, a(3) = 8550

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
