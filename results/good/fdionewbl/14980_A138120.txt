 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A138120: 
a(n) = 100000000*a(n - 3) - 10110000*a(n - 2) + 11010*a(n - 1) + 9989001
truth: 
a(n) = 11011*a(n - 1) + -10121010*a(n - 2) + 110110000*a(n - 3) + -100000000*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 101, a(1) = 1100011, a(2) = 11100000111, a(3) = 111100000001111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.
