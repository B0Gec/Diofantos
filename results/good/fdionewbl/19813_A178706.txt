 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A178706: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 70

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
