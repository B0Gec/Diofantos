 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A219085: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 24
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 42, a(4) = 91, a(5) = 166, a(6) = 274

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
