 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A178630: 
a(n) = -1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1) + 198
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 18, a(1) = 2178, a(2) = 221778

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
