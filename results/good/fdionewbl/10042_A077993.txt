 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A077993: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 2

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
