 3.5 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A001753: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -9*a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 40, a(4) = 86, a(5) = 166, a(6) = 296

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
