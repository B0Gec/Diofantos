A251863: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 1154*a(n - 2) + 768
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1154*a(n - 2) + -1154*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 147, a(2) = 3102, a(3) = 170407, a(4) = 3580474

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
