 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A272352: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 91, a(3) = 210

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
