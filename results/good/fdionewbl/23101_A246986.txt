 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A246986: 
a(n) = 24*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 50*a(n - 3) + -24*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 84

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
