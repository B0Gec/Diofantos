 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A216853: 
a(n) = -a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1) + 18
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -7, a(1) = 5, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 29

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
