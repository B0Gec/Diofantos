 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A126567: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 5) - 49*a(n - 4) + 76*a(n - 3) - 44*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -55*a(n - 2) + 120*a(n - 3) + -125*a(n - 4) + 52*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 42, a(5) = 132

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
