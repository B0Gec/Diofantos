by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A258131: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 398*a(n - 2) - 64548
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 398*a(n - 2) + -398*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 49665, a(1) = 348161, a(2) = 19701781, a(3) = 138502485, a(4) = 7841194625

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
