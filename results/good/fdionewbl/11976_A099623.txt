 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A099623: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 6

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
