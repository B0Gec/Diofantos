 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A028061: 
a(n) = -1050*a(n - 4) + 815*a(n - 3) - 221*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -221*a(n - 2) + 815*a(n - 3) + -1050*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 404, a(3) = 5390

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
