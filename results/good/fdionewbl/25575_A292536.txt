 3.9 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A292536: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 10*a(n - 4) + 26*a(n - 3) - 14*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 3) + -10*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 255, a(4) = 1310, a(5) = 6773

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
