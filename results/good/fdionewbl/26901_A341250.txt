 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A341250: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) - 3
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
