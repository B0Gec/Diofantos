 3.1 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A291029: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) - 18*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -18*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3) + -18*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 55, a(4) = 198, a(5) = 706

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
