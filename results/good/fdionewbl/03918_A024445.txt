 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A024445: 
a(n) = 840*a(n - 3) - 274*a(n - 2) + 29*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -303*a(n - 2) + 1114*a(n - 3) + -840*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 597, a(3) = 9934

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
