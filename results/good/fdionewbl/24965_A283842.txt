 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A283842: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 3) - 22*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -30*a(n - 2) + 47*a(n - 3) + -35*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
