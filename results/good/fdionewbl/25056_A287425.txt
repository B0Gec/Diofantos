 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A287425: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -11*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 47, a(5) = 98, a(6) = 198

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
