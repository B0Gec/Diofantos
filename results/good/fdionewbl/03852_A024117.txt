 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A024117: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 4) + 31*a(n - 3) - 33*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) + 54
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -46*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3) + -41*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 92, a(3) = 973, a(4) = 9936

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
