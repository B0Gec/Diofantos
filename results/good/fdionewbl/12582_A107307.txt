 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A107307: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -11*a(n - 3) + 16*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 183

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
