 1.9 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A178704: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + -7*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 15, a(5) = 49

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
