 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A014909: 
a(n) = -23*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 578

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
