 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A066407: 
a(n) = -1280*a(n - 4) + 1184*a(n - 3) - 336*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 34*a(n - 1) + -336*a(n - 2) + 1184*a(n - 3) + -1280*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2880, a(3) = 109440

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
