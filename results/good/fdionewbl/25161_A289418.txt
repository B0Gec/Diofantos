 1.7 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A289418: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 4) + 19*a(n - 3) - 21*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 40*a(n - 3) + -22*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 52, a(3) = 247, a(4) = 1053

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
