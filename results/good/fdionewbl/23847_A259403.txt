by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A259403: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 398*a(n - 2) - 32571
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 398*a(n - 2) + -398*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2882, a(1) = 27676, a(2) = 1114135, a(3) = 10982301, a(4) = 443390277

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
