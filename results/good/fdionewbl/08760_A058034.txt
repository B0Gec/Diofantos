 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A058034: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1) + 24
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 49, a(5) = 75

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
