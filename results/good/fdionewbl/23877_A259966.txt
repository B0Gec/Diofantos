 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A259966: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 16, a(5) = 34

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
