 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A178441: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 46, a(5) = 119, a(6) = 311

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
