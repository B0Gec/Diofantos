 3.8 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A221592: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 35, a(3) = 169, a(4) = 651, a(5) = 2715

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
