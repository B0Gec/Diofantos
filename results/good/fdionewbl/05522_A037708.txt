While total time consumed by now, scale:5523/27236, seq_id:A037708, order:20 took:
 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A037708: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -10*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 130, a(3) = 1302, a(4) = 13021

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
