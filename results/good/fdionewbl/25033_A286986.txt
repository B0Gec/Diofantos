by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A286986: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 54, a(3) = 175

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
