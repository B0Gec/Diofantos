A042190: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 498*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 498*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 24, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 224, a(3) = 249, a(4) = 12176, a(5) = 12425, a(6) = 111576, a(7) = 124001

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
