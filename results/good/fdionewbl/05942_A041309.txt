by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A041309: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 336*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 336*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 324, a(5) = 337, a(6) = 4031, a(7) = 4368

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
