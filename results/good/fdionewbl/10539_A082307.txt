 1.6 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A082307: 
a(n) = -64*a(n - 4) + 96*a(n - 3) - 52*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -52*a(n - 2) + 96*a(n - 3) + -64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 66

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
