by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A199927: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = -7, a(3) = 3

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
