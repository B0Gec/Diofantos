 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A074520: 
a(n) = -42*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1) + 30
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -55*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 86

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
