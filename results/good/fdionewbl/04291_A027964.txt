by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A027964: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 73, a(4) = 174, a(5) = 373

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
