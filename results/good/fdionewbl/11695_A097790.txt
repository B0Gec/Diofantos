 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A097790: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -26*a(n - 2) + 34*a(n - 3) + -21*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 55, a(3) = 295, a(4) = 1510

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
