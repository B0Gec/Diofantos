 9.5 seconds, i.e. 0.16 minutes or 0.003 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 11. 
A278580: 
a(n) = a(n - 11) + 23
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 1*a(n - 11) + -1*a(n - 12),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 8, a(6) = 9, a(7) = 12, a(8) = 13, a(9) = 16, a(10) = 18, a(11) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
