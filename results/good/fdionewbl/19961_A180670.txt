While total time consumed by now, scale:19962/27236, seq_id:A180670, order:20 took:
 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A180670: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1) + 16
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 42, a(5) = 140, a(6) = 383

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
