While total time consumed by now, scale:21062/27236, seq_id:A199626, order:20 took:
 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A199626: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 1) - 15
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -4, a(2) = -6, a(3) = -8, a(4) = -7, a(5) = -12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
