 3.2 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A141582: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -5*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 21, a(5) = 48, a(6) = 93

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
