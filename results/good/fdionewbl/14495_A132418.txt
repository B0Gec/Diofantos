 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A132418: 
a(n) = 43*a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 43*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 21

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
