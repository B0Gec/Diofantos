by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A098582: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 5) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 15

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
