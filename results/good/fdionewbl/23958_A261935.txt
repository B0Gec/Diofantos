by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A261935: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 70*a(n - 2) + 544
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 70*a(n - 2) + -70*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 933, a(3) = 2175, a(4) = 65849

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
