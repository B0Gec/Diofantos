 0.7 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A248160: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 10*a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) - 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -5, a(2) = 13, a(3) = -25, a(4) = 40

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
