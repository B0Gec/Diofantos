 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A116746: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 2
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -22*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 75

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
