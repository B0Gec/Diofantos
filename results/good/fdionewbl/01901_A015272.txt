 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A015272: 
a(n) = 15625*a(n - 3) + 2625*a(n - 2) - 105*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = -104*a(n - 1) + 2730*a(n - 2) + 13000*a(n - 3) + -15625*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -104, a(2) = 13546, a(3) = -1679704

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
