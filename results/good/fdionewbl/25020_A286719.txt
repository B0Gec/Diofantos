A286719: 
a(n) = -945*a(n - 4) + 744*a(n - 3) - 206*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -230*a(n - 2) + 950*a(n - 3) + -1689*a(n - 4) + 945*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 395, a(3) = 5075, a(4) = 58086

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
