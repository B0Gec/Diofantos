 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A330170: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 3) - 36*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1) + 10
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 72*a(n - 3) + -36*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 10, a(1) = 48, a(2) = 250, a(3) = 1392

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
