 1.1 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A241029: 
a(n) = 484*a(n - 3) - 308*a(n - 2) + 35*a(n - 1) - 210
truth: 
a(n) = 36*a(n - 1) + -343*a(n - 2) + 792*a(n - 3) + -484*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 36, a(2) = 610, a(3) = 11988

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
