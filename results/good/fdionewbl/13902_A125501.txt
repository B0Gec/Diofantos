 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A125501: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 36*a(n - 5) - 105*a(n - 4) + 112*a(n - 3) - 54*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -54*a(n - 2) + 112*a(n - 3) + -105*a(n - 4) + 36*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 42, a(5) = 132

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
