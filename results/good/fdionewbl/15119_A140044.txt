 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A140044: 
a(n) = 1250*a(n - 5) - 125*a(n - 4) - 250*a(n - 3) + 25*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + 25*a(n - 2) + -250*a(n - 3) + -125*a(n - 4) + 1250*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 175, a(3) = 2025, a(4) = 19500

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
