 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A116773: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 5) - 20*a(n - 4) + 33*a(n - 3) - 24*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -32*a(n - 2) + 57*a(n - 3) + -53*a(n - 4) + 24*a(n - 5) + -4*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 241

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
