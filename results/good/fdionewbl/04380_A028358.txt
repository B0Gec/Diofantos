 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A028358: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 5
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 20, a(4) = 33, a(5) = 48

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
