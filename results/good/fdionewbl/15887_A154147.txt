by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A154147: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 2) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 6*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 60, a(4) = 179

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
