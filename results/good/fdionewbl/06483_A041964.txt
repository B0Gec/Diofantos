A041964: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 1618*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1618*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 22, a(1) = 45, a(2) = 382, a(3) = 809, a(4) = 35978, a(5) = 72765, a(6) = 618098, a(7) = 1308961

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
