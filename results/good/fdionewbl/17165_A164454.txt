A164454: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 34, a(3) = 52, a(4) = 79, a(5) = 120, a(6) = 179

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
