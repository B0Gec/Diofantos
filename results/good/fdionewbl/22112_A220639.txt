 2.8 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A220639: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 29*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) - 8
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 22*a(n - 2) + -20*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 369, a(4) = 3755, a(5) = 37320

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
