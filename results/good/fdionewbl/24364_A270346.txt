 0.3 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A270346: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) + 17
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -11*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 280, a(3) = 3087, a(4) = 33959

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
