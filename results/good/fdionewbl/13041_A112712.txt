 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A112712: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -1, a(4) = -1, a(5) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
