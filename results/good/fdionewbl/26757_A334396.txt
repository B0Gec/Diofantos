by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A334396: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
