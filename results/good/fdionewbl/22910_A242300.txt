 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A242300: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 35, a(4) = 105, a(5) = 292

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
