 3.5 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 7. 
A164430: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + -1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 62, a(4) = 105, a(5) = 178, a(6) = 303

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
