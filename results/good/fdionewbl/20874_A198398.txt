 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A198398: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1) + 56
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 48

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
