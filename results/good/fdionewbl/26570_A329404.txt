by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A329404: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) - a(n - 1) + 36
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 21, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 65

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
