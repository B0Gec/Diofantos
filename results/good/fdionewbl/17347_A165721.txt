 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A165721: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1) + 6
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + -3*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 35, a(5) = 55, a(6) = 69

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
