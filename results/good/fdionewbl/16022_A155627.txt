 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A155627: 
a(n) = -24*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1) + 15
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -34*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
