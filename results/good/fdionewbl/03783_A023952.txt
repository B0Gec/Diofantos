 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A023952: 
a(n) = 462*a(n - 3) - 185*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -209*a(n - 2) + 647*a(n - 3) + -462*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 416, a(3) = 5822

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
