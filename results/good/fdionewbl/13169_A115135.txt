by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A115135: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 3) + 1234
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 108, a(2) = 1407, a(3) = 1851, a(4) = 2407, a(5) = 9768, a(6) = 12340

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
