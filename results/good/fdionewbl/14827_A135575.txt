 2.7 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A135575: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = -5, a(3) = 9, a(4) = -16

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
