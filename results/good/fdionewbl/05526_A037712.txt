 1.0 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A037712: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 72, a(3) = 504

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
