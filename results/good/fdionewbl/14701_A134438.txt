 3.0 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A134438: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 23, a(5) = 62

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
