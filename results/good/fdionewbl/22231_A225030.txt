 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A225030: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 973*a(n - 4) + 782*a(n - 3) - 218*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -218*a(n - 2) + 782*a(n - 3) + -973*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 29, a(3) = 193, a(4) = 1441

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
