 0.4 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A133186: 
a(n) = -a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
