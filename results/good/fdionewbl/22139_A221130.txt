 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A221130: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) - 3
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
