 1.3 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 8. 
A089089: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 19, a(6) = 34, a(7) = 65

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
