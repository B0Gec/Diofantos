 0.6 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A015257: 
a(n) = 216*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 31*a(n - 1) + 186*a(n - 2) + -216*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 31, a(2) = 1147

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
