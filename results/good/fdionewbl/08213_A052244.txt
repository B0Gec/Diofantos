 0.2 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A052244: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 3) - 11*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -18*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 46, a(3) = 240

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
