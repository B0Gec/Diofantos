 1.8 seconds, i.e. 0.03 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A291390: 
a(n) = -25*a(n - 4) - 50*a(n - 3) - 15*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + -50*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 130, a(3) = 940

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
