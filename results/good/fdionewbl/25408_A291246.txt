 1.5 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 4. 
A291246: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 35, a(2) = 210, a(3) = 1259

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
