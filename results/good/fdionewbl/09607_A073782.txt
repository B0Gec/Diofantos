by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A073782: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 19, a(3) = 48, a(4) = 89, a(5) = 190

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
