 3.4 seconds, i.e. 0.06 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A215139: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 6) - 14*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -14*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 91, a(5) = 69

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
