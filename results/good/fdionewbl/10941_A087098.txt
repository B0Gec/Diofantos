 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A087098: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 6) - 5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) - 11
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + -2*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 15, a(4) = 37, a(5) = 44, a(6) = 77

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
