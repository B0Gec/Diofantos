A206547: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) + 42
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 0*a(n - 8) + 0*a(n - 9) + 0*a(n - 10) + 0*a(n - 11) + 1*a(n - 12) + -1*a(n - 13),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 17, a(5) = 19, a(6) = 23, a(7) = 25, a(8) = 29, a(9) = 31, a(10) = 37, a(11) = 41, a(12) = 43

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
