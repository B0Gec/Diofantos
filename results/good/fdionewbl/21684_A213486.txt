 0.5 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A213486: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) - 3*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -7*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 48, a(5) = 78

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
