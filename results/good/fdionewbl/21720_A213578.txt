by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A213578: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1) + 2
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 34, a(4) = 80, a(5) = 174

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
