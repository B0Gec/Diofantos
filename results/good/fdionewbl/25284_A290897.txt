 2.9 seconds, i.e. 0.05 minutes or 0.001 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A290897: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) - 19*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) - 19*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + -19*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 29, a(4) = 95, a(5) = 307

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
