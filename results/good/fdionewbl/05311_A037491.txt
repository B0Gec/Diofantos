 0.1 seconds, i.e. 0.0 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 2. 
A037491: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1) + 3
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 80

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
