 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.01 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A028814: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1) - 1
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 78

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
