 0.9 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 6. 
A090596: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + -8*a(n - 6) + -8*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 7, a(5) = 12, a(6) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
