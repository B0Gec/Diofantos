by degree: 1 and order: 5. 
A256322: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 49
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 37, a(4) = 65, a(5) = 102

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
