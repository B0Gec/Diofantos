 1.2 seconds, i.e. 0.02 minutes or 0.0 hours.

by degree: 1 and order: 3. 
A021544: 
a(n) = 168*a(n - 3) - 101*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1) + 1
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -119*a(n - 2) + 269*a(n - 3) + -168*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 242, a(3) = 2606

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
