1) lower number of terms (will prevent miscroscopic values of constants)
2) constants in ratio (mean we discovered integer equation - i.e. something)
3) sometimes output is mix of 2 equations. Which should mavi choose - something to research

4) I think not robust to big coefficients, i.e. if an = 3*a(n-1) is ground truth it is already risky to trust mavi
    research: more settings, like 0.1 to research best choice of this hyperparameter for such cases.
5) for now 50% worse than sindy or diof
6) maybe swaped n and 1 columns. - check it
