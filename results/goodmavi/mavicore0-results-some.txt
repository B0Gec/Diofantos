Opažanje0:
če zaporedje vsebuje prevelike clene, gredo konstante proti 0 -> vse se zašumi.
    -> Solution: take only first some elements. Best option for number of terms still debatable.
Observation1:
if solution has coefficient in certain ratio this is a good sign of equation being correct.
  ( if in ratio, that some constant is multiple of another by a integer we can convert it to
    integer equation by dividing it by some ratoinal number. On the contrary, if not in some nice
    ratio and constants seem random, probable the weird term is incorrect or we did not reconstruct anything.



todo: less terms since very low size of constants values
