### Answer by this bfiles: in dataset we keep: 
###     *keyword:core keyword:nice 
###     * and delete all sequences with absolute terms > 1e16.
###     * and delete sequence Mersene A000043, since only 47 terms (in hard keyword)
###             because we need at least 47 or should I say 100 terms (as it turns out).
###     ** it turns out all other remaining sequences in core have at least 100 terms. Very good.
