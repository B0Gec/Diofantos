for starters:
grammar = poly  (or maybe universal)
grammar probs = default
sample_size = 100
lower_upper_bounds = (-5,5) if direct (and order =0) else (-10, 10) if recursive.
(recursion only) order = 4


3 models direct: 159s = 3min
100 models direct: 1h30m?
3 models recursive: 285s = 3min
100 models recursive: 3h?
