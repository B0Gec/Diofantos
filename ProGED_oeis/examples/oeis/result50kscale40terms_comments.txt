wierd, seems a bug!!!:
to check:

truth: a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 10),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 41, a(6) = 125, a(7) = 389, a(8) = 1220, a(9) = 3829
We found an equation!!!:
eq:  a(n) = -a(n - 10) + 10*a(n - 9) + 25*a(n - 8) - 37*a(n - 7) - 54*a(n - 6) - 37*a(n - 5) + 28*a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
