- for each linear recursion equation exists one with higher order, e.g.:
    a_n = c*a_{n-1} order 1
    -> a_{n-1} = c*a_{n-2} -> a_{n} = c*a_{n-1} = c*c*a_{n-2} 
    tj.
    -> a_{n} = c*c*a_{n-2} order 2
- so, idea: solve for biggest order. If exists: try half order, i.e. order/2
and repeat until no solution to get with bisection smalllest order solution.
- find out if diophantine solver gives answer to existence of ambiguous solution.
- limit the order, since biggest is 131000 


Parsing:
 - e.g. look only if order matches
 - doublecheck: for each seq test if found equation holds for first few terms
and then also for all on web.
