While total time consumed by now, scale:3001/34371, seq_id:A016024, order:20 took:
 43.0 seconds, i.e. 0.72 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A016024: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) + a(n - 17) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
