 51.3 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A263944: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 5*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 28, a(1) = 189, a(2) = 959

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
