 50.5 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A138269: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 53

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
