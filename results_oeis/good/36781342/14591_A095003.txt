 46.1 seconds, i.e. 0.77 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A095003: 
a(n) = -4*n - 6*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
