 31.0 seconds, i.e. 0.52 minutes or 0.009 hours.

A309970: 
a(n) = a(n - 14) + a(n - 10)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
