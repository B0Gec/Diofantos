 34.9 seconds, i.e. 0.58 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A131722: 
a(n) = a(n - 12)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 10, a(5) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
