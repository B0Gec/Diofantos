 60.5 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A228920: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
