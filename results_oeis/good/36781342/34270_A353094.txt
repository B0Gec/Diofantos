 57.2 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A353094: 
a(n) = -n - 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 21

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
