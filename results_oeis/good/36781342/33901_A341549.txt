A341549: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -7*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 50, a(4) = 131

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
