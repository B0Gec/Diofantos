 67.4 seconds, i.e. 1.12 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A131709: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 6) - 9*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 104

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
