 39.6 seconds, i.e. 0.66 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A040936: 
a(n) = a(n - 12)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 31, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 1, a(5) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
