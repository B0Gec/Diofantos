 67.3 seconds, i.e. 1.12 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A017897: 
a(n) = 135*a(n - 3) - 87*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -87*a(n - 2) + 135*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 202

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
