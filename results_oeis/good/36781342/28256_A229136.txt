 45.9 seconds, i.e. 0.77 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A229136: 
a(n) = 32*a(n - 4) + 8*a(n - 3) - 16*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
