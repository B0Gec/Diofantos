While total time consumed by now, scale:10720/34371, seq_id:A052749, order:20 took:
 68.7 seconds, i.e. 1.15 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A052749: 
a(n) = -2*n + 4*a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
