 43.5 seconds, i.e. 0.72 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A335927: 
a(n) = n - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
