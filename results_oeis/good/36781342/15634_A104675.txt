While total time consumed by now, scale:15635/34371, seq_id:A104675, order:20 took:
 73.8 seconds, i.e. 1.23 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A104675: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
