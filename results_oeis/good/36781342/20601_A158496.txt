 51.6 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A158496: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -4, a(2) = -1, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
