 58.6 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A014913: 
a(n) = 2*n + 24*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 26*a(n - 1) + -49*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 26, a(2) = 627

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
