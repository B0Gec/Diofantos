While total time consumed by now, scale:31206/34371, seq_id:A279512, order:20 took:
 76.6 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A279512: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 20) - 8*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 85

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
