 78.8 seconds, i.e. 1.31 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A107443: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
