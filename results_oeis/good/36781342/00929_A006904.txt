 55.0 seconds, i.e. 0.92 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A006904: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
