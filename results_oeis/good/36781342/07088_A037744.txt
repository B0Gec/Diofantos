 34.7 seconds, i.e. 0.58 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A037744: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 44, a(3) = 177, a(4) = 710

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
