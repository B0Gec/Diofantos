While total time consumed by now, scale:25480/34371, seq_id:A183120, order:20 took:
 63.5 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A183120: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - 3*a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
