While total time consumed by now, scale:27851/34371, seq_id:A221905, order:20 took:
 61.0 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A221905: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 3*a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
