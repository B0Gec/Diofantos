 77.8 seconds, i.e. 1.3 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A020975: 
a(n) = 924*a(n - 3) - 293*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -293*a(n - 2) + 924*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 607

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
