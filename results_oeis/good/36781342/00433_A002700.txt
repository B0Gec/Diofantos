While total time consumed by now, scale:434/34371, seq_id:A002700, order:20 took:
 50.9 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A002700: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 36*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 40, a(2) = 336

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
