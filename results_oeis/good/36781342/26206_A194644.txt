 62.0 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A194644: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 12, a(1) = 32, a(2) = 90

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
