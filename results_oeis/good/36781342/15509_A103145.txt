While total time consumed by now, scale:15510/34371, seq_id:A103145, order:20 took:
 74.6 seconds, i.e. 1.24 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A103145: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + a(n - 14) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 43, a(3) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
