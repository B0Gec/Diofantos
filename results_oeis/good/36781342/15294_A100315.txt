While total time consumed by now, scale:15295/34371, seq_id:A100315, order:20 took:
 76.8 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A100315: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 2*a(n - 11) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
