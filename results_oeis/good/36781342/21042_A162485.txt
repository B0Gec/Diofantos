 35.5 seconds, i.e. 0.59 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A162485: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - 2*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
