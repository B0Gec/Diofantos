 64.7 seconds, i.e. 1.08 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A094806: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
