 46.4 seconds, i.e. 0.77 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A120468: 
a(n) = -9*a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) + 9*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 10*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -9*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 142

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
