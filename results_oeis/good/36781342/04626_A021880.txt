While total time consumed by now, scale:4627/34371, seq_id:A021880, order:20 took:
 78.2 seconds, i.e. 1.3 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A021880: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
