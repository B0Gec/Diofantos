While total time consumed by now, scale:43/34371, seq_id:A000295, order:20 took:
 61.2 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A000295: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 2*a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
