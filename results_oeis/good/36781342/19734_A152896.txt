 61.5 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A152896: 
a(n) = 4*n + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 55, a(4) = 183

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
