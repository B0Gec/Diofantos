 64.6 seconds, i.e. 1.08 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A038845: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) + 16*a(n - 3) - 36*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 1) + -48*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 96

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
