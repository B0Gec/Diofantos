 54.5 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A033133: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 42, a(3) = 253

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
