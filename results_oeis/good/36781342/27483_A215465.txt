 68.3 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A215465: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 9*a(n - 4) - 13*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
