A106706: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 12) + a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 19, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 22, a(4) = 17, a(5) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
