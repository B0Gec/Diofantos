 70.4 seconds, i.e. 1.17 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A333616: 
a(n) = n + a(n - 17) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
