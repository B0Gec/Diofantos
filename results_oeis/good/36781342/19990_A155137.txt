While total time consumed by now, scale:19991/34371, seq_id:A155137, order:20 took:
 65.9 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A155137: 
a(n) = -a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 48, a(3) = 57

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
