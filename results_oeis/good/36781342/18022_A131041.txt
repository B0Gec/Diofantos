While total time consumed by now, scale:18023/34371, seq_id:A131041, order:20 took:
 45.7 seconds, i.e. 0.76 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A131041: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
