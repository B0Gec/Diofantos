While total time consumed by now, scale:14485/34371, seq_id:A094254, order:20 took:
 88.6 seconds, i.e. 1.48 minutes or 0.025 hours.

A094254: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 9) - 2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
