 53.0 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A037705: 
a(n) = -7*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -7*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 70, a(3) = 492, a(4) = 3445

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
