 38.0 seconds, i.e. 0.63 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A019672: 
a(n) = 352*a(n - 3) - 164*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -164*a(n - 2) + 352*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 365

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
