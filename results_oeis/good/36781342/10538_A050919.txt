 90.4 seconds, i.e. 1.51 minutes or 0.025 hours.

A050919: 
a(n) = 49*a(n - 9) - 14*a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) - 49*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -63*a(n - 2) + 49*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 99

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
