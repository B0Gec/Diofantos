 66.7 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A074506: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 8) - 7*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 26

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
