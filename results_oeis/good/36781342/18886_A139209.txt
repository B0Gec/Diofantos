While total time consumed by now, scale:18887/34371, seq_id:A139209, order:20 took:
 61.6 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A139209: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = -1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
