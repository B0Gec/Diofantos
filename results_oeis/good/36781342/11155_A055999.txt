 52.5 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A055999: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 14) - a(n - 13) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
