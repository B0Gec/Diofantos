 58.4 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A014901: 
a(n) = 2*n + 18*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -37*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 20, a(2) = 363

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
