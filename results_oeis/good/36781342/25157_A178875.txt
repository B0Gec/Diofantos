 58.1 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A178875: 
a(n) = n + 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 9, a(4) = 37

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
