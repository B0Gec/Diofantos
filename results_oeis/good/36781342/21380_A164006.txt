While total time consumed by now, scale:21381/34371, seq_id:A164006, order:20 took:
 70.5 seconds, i.e. 1.17 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A164006: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
