While total time consumed by now, scale:15225/34371, seq_id:A100103, order:20 took:
 67.1 seconds, i.e. 1.12 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A100103: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
