While total time consumed by now, scale:20034/34371, seq_id:A155609, order:20 took:
 52.8 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A155609: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 20) - 7*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - 12*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
