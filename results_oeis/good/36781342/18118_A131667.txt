While total time consumed by now, scale:18119/34371, seq_id:A131667, order:20 took:
 66.0 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A131667: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 4, a(4) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
