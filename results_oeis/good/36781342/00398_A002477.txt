While total time consumed by now, scale:399/34371, seq_id:A002477, order:20 took:
 79.3 seconds, i.e. 1.32 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A002477: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 7) - 110*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 121, a(2) = 12321

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
