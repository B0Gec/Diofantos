 53.3 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A081140: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 3) - 300*a(n - 2) + 30*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 30*a(n - 1) + -300*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
