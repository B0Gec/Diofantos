 121.0 seconds, i.e. 2.02 minutes or 0.034 hours.

A196472: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
