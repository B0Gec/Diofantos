 65.1 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A289786: 
a(n) = a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 77

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
