 57.1 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A020499: 
a(n) = 495*a(n - 3) - 199*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -199*a(n - 2) + 495*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 426

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
