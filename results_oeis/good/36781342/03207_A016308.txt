 60.6 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A016308: 
a(n) = 132*a(n - 4) + 32*a(n - 3) - 81*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 19*a(n - 1) + -100*a(n - 2) + 132*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 261

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
