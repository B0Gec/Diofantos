 62.7 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A263426: 
a(n) = -a(n - 18) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
