 61.5 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A130014: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - 6*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 43, a(2) = 2440, a(3) = 2643, a(4) = 2860, a(5) = 16443, a(6) = 17620

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
