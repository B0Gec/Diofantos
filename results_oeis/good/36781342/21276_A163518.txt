 75.7 seconds, i.e. 1.26 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A163518: 
a(n) = -231*a(n - 5) + 21*a(n - 4) + 21*a(n - 3) + 21*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + 21*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3) + 21*a(n - 4) + -231*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 506, a(3) = 11132, a(4) = 244904

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
