 62.8 seconds, i.e. 1.05 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A093041: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
