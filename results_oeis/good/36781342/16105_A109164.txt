While total time consumed by now, scale:16106/34371, seq_id:A109164, order:20 took:
 38.5 seconds, i.e. 0.64 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A109164: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
