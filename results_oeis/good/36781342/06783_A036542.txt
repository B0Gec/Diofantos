 56.8 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A036542: 
a(n) = -n + 4*a(n - 8) - 4*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
