 60.7 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A016633: 
a(n) = 264*a(n - 4) + 86*a(n - 3) - 153*a(n - 2) + 24*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -178*a(n - 2) + 264*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 447

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
