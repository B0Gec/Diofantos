While total time consumed by now, scale:14011/34371, seq_id:A088013, order:20 took:
 41.0 seconds, i.e. 0.68 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A088013: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) - 4*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
