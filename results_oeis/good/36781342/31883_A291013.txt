While total time consumed by now, scale:31884/34371, seq_id:A291013, order:20 took:
 46.2 seconds, i.e. 0.77 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A291013: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
