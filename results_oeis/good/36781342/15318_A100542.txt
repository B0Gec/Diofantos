While total time consumed by now, scale:15319/34371, seq_id:A100542, order:20 took:
 92.6 seconds, i.e. 1.54 minutes or 0.026 hours.

A100542: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
