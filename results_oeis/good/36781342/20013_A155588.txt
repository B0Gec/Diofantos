 50.6 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A155588: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
