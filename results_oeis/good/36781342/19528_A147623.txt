While total time consumed by now, scale:19529/34371, seq_id:A147623, order:20 took:
 75.5 seconds, i.e. 1.26 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A147623: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
