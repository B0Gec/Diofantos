 35.9 seconds, i.e. 0.6 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A046633: 
a(n) = -3*n - 2*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 21, a(3) = 101

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
