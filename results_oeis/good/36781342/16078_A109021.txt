While total time consumed by now, scale:16079/34371, seq_id:A109021, order:20 took:
 45.6 seconds, i.e. 0.76 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A109021: 
a(n) = -10*a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) - 21*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -31*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
