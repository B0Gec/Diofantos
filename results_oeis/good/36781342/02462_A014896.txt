 45.5 seconds, i.e. 0.76 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A014896: 
a(n) = 2*n + 13*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 198

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
