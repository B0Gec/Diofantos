 75.1 seconds, i.e. 1.25 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A135350: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
