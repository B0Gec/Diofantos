While total time consumed by now, scale:17120/34371, seq_id:A121138, order:20 took:
 65.2 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A121138: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) - 32*a(n - 3) - 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + -32*a(n - 3) + 64*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 10

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
