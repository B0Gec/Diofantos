While total time consumed by now, scale:32172/34371, seq_id:A293070, order:20 took:
 52.2 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A293070: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 6) + 9*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) - 5*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -19*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
