While total time consumed by now, scale:7051/34371, seq_id:A037706, order:20 took:
 35.4 seconds, i.e. 0.59 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A037706: 
a(n) = -3*n - 2*a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 88, a(3) = 706, a(4) = 5649

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
