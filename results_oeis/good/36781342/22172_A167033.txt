 51.3 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A167033: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) - 20*a(n - 3) - 63*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -84*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 379

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
