 78.8 seconds, i.e. 1.31 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A291184: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) - 9*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 104, a(3) = 507

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
