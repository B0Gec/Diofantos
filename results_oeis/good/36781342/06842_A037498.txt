 57.8 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A037498: 
a(n) = -n - a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 27, a(3) = 136

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
