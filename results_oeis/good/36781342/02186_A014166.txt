A014166: 
a(n) = n + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 41, a(5) = 92

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
