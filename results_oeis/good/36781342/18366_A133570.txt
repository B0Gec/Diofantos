While total time consumed by now, scale:18367/34371, seq_id:A133570, order:20 took:
 54.0 seconds, i.e. 0.9 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A133570: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = -4, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
