While total time consumed by now, scale:21384/34371, seq_id:A164009, order:20 took:
 64.4 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A164009: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 38

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
