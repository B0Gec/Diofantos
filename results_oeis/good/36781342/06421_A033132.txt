While total time consumed by now, scale:6422/34371, seq_id:A033132, order:20 took:
 38.8 seconds, i.e. 0.65 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A033132: 
a(n) = -4*n - a(n - 20) - 2*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 30, a(3) = 151

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
