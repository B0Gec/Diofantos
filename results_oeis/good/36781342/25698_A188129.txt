While total time consumed by now, scale:25699/34371, seq_id:A188129, order:20 took:
 66.8 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A188129: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - 5*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
