While total time consumed by now, scale:10506/34371, seq_id:A050400, order:20 took:
 61.0 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A050400: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 6*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + 6*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 8*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 17, a(3) = 43, a(4) = 181

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
