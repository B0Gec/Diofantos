 51.0 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A291264: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 4*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 36, a(3) = 104

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
