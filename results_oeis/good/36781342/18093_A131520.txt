 53.6 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A131520: 
a(n) = -2*n - 2*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
