While total time consumed by now, scale:14164/34371, seq_id:A090326, order:20 took:
 60.4 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A090326: 
a(n) = 4*n + 6*a(n - 8) - 5*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 6*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 15, a(3) = 54

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
