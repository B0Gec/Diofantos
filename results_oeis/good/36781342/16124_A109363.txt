While total time consumed by now, scale:16125/34371, seq_id:A109363, order:20 took:
 59.3 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A109363: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) - 2*a(n - 11) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
