 55.2 seconds, i.e. 0.92 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A076140: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 14*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
