While total time consumed by now, scale:2484/34371, seq_id:A014917, order:20 took:
 74.8 seconds, i.e. 1.25 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A014917: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 8) - 10*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - 25*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 86

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
