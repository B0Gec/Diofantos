 50.8 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A019478: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 15, a(2) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
