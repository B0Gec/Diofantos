 36.1 seconds, i.e. 0.6 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A141518: 
a(n) = a(n - 10)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
