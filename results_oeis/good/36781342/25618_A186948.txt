While total time consumed by now, scale:25619/34371, seq_id:A186948, order:20 took:
 74.3 seconds, i.e. 1.24 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A186948: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
