While total time consumed by now, scale:15217/34371, seq_id:A100050, order:20 took:
 54.8 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A100050: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
