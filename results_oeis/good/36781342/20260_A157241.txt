 48.5 seconds, i.e. 0.81 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A157241: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
