While total time consumed by now, scale:19069/34371, seq_id:A140800, order:20 took:
 49.9 seconds, i.e. 0.83 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A140800: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
