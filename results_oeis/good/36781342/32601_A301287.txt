A301287: 
a(n) = -a(n - 14) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
