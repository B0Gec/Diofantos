While total time consumed by now, scale:15648/34371, seq_id:A104745, order:20 took:
 81.1 seconds, i.e. 1.35 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A104745: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) - 5*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) - 5*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
