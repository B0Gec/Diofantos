 58.9 seconds, i.e. 0.98 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A249998: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 12*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
