While total time consumed by now, scale:26365/34371, seq_id:A197986, order:20 took:
 60.0 seconds, i.e. 1.0 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A197986: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 77

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
