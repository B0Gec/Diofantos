 47.1 seconds, i.e. 0.78 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A063223: 
a(n) = -a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 34, a(4) = 44

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
