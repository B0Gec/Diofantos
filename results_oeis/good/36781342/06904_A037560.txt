 44.0 seconds, i.e. 0.73 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A037560: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 8, a(2) = 25, a(3) = 77

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
