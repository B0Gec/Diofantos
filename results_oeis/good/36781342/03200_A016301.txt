 56.1 seconds, i.e. 0.94 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A016301: 
a(n) = 110*a(n - 4) + 23*a(n - 3) - 69*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -87*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 18, a(2) = 237

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
