While total time consumed by now, scale:29105/34371, seq_id:A248848, order:20 took:
 63.5 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A248848: 
a(n) = 3*n - 7*a(n - 20) - a(n - 4) + 9*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 82, a(3) = 765

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
