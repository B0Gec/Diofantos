 61.7 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A179994: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
