While total time consumed by now, scale:18720/34371, seq_id:A136783, order:20 took:
 59.1 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A136783: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 3) - 18*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -27*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
