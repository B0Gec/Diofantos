 58.1 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A181367: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
