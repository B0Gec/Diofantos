 66.8 seconds, i.e. 1.11 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A095931: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 4) - 9*a(n - 3) - 6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
