 63.6 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A123950: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
