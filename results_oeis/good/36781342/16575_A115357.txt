 67.7 seconds, i.e. 1.13 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A115357: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
