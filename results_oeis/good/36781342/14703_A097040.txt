 50.7 seconds, i.e. 0.85 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A097040: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
