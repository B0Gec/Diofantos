 56.7 seconds, i.e. 0.94 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A271827: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
