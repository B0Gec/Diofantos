 61.6 seconds, i.e. 1.03 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A178719: 
a(n) = n - 6*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + -7*a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
