 60.2 seconds, i.e. 1.0 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A101881: 
a(n) = n + a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
