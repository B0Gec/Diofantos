While total time consumed by now, scale:4956/34371, seq_id:A023551, order:20 took:
 45.1 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A023551: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 24, a(2) = 46, a(3) = 76

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
