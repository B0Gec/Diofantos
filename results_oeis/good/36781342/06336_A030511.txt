While total time consumed by now, scale:6337/34371, seq_id:A030511, order:20 took:
 77.0 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A030511: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 17) - a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 10, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 24

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
