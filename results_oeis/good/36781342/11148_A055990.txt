 56.6 seconds, i.e. 0.94 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A055990: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 50

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
