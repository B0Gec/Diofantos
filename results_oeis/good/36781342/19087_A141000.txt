While total time consumed by now, scale:19088/34371, seq_id:A141000, order:20 took:
 36.2 seconds, i.e. 0.6 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A141000: 
a(n) = -a(n - 11) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
