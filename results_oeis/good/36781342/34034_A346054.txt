A346054: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 4) + 5*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -8*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 13, a(5) = 52

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
