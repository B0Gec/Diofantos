 52.1 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A007798: 
a(n) = 15*a(n - 10) - 8*a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - 15*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -23*a(n - 2) + 15*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
