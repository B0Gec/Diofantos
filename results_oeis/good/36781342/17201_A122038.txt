 62.2 seconds, i.e. 1.04 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A122038: 
a(n) = 729*a(n - 3) - 351*a(n - 2) + 39*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 39*a(n - 1) + -351*a(n - 2) + 729*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 36, a(1) = 864, a(2) = 21060

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
