While total time consumed by now, scale:6518/34371, seq_id:A033714, order:20 took:
 79.2 seconds, i.e. 1.32 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A033714: 
a(n) = 100*a(n - 14) - 20*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 100*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -120*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 190

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
