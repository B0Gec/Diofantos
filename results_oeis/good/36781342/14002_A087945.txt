 34.6 seconds, i.e. 0.58 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A087945: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - 7*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
