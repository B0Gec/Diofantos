While total time consumed by now, scale:2356/34371, seq_id:A014655, order:20 took:
 47.0 seconds, i.e. 0.78 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A014655: 
a(n) = a(n - 17) - a(n - 15) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 11) + a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
