 57.8 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A038505: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
