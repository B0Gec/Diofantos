A103949: 
a(n) = a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 256, a(2) = 100, a(3) = 116, a(4) = 73, a(5) = 148

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
