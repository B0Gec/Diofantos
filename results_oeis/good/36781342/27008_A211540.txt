While total time consumed by now, scale:27009/34371, seq_id:A211540, order:20 took:
 52.8 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A211540: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
