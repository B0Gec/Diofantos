While total time consumed by now, scale:17116/34371, seq_id:A121133, order:20 took:
 67.0 seconds, i.e. 1.12 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A121133: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -8*a(n - 3) + 8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
