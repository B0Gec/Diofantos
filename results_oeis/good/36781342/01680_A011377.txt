While total time consumed by now, scale:1681/34371, seq_id:A011377, order:20 took:
 70.7 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A011377: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
