 54.6 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A100313: 
a(n) = -16*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 5) + 8*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 10*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -24*a(n - 2) + 32*a(n - 3) + -16*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 96, a(3) = 400

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
