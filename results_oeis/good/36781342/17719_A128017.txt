While total time consumed by now, scale:17720/34371, seq_id:A128017, order:20 took:
 36.0 seconds, i.e. 0.6 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A128017: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
