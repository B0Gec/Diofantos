While total time consumed by now, scale:5811/34371, seq_id:A028569, order:20 took:
 73.5 seconds, i.e. 1.22 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A028569: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 16) - a(n - 11) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
