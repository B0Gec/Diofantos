 59.5 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A215005: 
a(n) = n + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 12

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
