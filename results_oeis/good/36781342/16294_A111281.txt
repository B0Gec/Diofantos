 63.2 seconds, i.e. 1.05 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A111281: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 7) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
