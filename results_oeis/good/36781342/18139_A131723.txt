While total time consumed by now, scale:18140/34371, seq_id:A131723, order:20 took:
 72.4 seconds, i.e. 1.21 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A131723: 
a(n) = -a(n - 15) + a(n - 13) + a(n - 11) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
