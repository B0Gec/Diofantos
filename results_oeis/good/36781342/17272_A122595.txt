While total time consumed by now, scale:17273/34371, seq_id:A122595, order:20 took:
 43.0 seconds, i.e. 0.72 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A122595: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
