While total time consumed by now, scale:1680/34371, seq_id:A011367, order:20 took:
 32.3 seconds, i.e. 0.54 minutes or 0.009 hours.

A011367: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 29

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
