 51.9 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A016322: 
a(n) = 198*a(n - 4) + 59*a(n - 3) - 117*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 22*a(n - 1) + -139*a(n - 2) + 198*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 345

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
