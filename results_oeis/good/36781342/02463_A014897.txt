 60.3 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A014897: 
a(n) = 2*n + 14*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 16*a(n - 1) + -29*a(n - 2) + 14*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 16, a(2) = 227

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
