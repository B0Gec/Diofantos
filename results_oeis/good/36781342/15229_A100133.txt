 60.3 seconds, i.e. 1.0 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A100133: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 6) + 3*a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
