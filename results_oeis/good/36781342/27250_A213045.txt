While total time consumed by now, scale:27251/34371, seq_id:A213045, order:20 took:
 51.8 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A213045: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 36, a(4) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
