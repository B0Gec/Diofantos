 73.9 seconds, i.e. 1.23 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A123392: 
a(n) = -a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
