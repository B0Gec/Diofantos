 75.6 seconds, i.e. 1.26 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A154807: 
a(n) = -100000*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 100000*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 100000*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -100000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 11111, a(1) = 1111100000, a(2) = 111110000011111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
