While total time consumed by now, scale:25961/34371, seq_id:A192447, order:20 took:
 49.5 seconds, i.e. 0.82 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A192447: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 18) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
