 81.6 seconds, i.e. 1.36 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A105866: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
