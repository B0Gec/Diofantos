While total time consumed by now, scale:21228/34371, seq_id:A163322, order:20 took:
 57.1 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A163322: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = -4, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 180

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
