 46.7 seconds, i.e. 0.78 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A337928: 
a(n) = -2*n + a(n - 20) + a(n - 19) - a(n - 3) + 6*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -8*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 31

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
