While total time consumed by now, scale:33313/34371, seq_id:A322598, order:20 took:
 57.7 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A322598: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 20, a(5) = 29

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
