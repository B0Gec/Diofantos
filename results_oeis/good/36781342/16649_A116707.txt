While total time consumed by now, scale:16650/34371, seq_id:A116707, order:20 took:
 54.3 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A116707: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 7) + 8*a(n - 6) + 8*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 4*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -16*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
