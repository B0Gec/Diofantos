 95.5 seconds, i.e. 1.59 minutes or 0.027 hours.

A245023: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 4*a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
