 51.5 seconds, i.e. 0.86 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A291772: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) + 17*a(n - 4) + 7*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 3) + 17*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 61, a(3) = 316, a(4) = 1304

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
