 77.8 seconds, i.e. 1.3 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A045618: 
a(n) = 3*n - 4*a(n - 4) - a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 23, a(3) = 72

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
