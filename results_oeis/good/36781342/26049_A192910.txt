While total time consumed by now, scale:26050/34371, seq_id:A192910, order:20 took:
 44.7 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A192910: 
a(n) = -a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 42

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
