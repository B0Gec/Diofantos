 50.3 seconds, i.e. 0.84 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A172416: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) + 2*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
