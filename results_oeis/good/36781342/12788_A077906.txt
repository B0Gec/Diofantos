 44.2 seconds, i.e. 0.74 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A077906: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 5) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
