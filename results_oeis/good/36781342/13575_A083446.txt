While total time consumed by now, scale:13576/34371, seq_id:A083446, order:20 took:
 63.4 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A083446: 
a(n) = 90*a(n - 18) - 19*a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - 90*a(n - 2) + 19*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 20*a(n - 1) + -109*a(n - 2) + 90*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 30, a(2) = 382

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
