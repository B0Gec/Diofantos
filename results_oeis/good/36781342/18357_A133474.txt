 52.8 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A133474: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 6) + 6*a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 9*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
