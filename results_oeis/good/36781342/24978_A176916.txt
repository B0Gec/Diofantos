While total time consumed by now, scale:24979/34371, seq_id:A176916, order:20 took:
 69.0 seconds, i.e. 1.15 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A176916: 
a(n) = -n + 2*a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) + 2*a(n - 18) - a(n - 17) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
