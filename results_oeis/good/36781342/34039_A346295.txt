While total time consumed by now, scale:34040/34371, seq_id:A346295, order:20 took:
 55.7 seconds, i.e. 0.93 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A346295: 
a(n) = -8*a(n - 7) + 6*a(n - 6) + 7*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 7*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 22*a(n - 3) + -8*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 24, a(3) = 69

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
