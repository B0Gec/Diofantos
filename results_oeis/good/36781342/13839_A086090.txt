 45.2 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A086090: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 13*a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -21*a(n - 2) + 18*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 22

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
