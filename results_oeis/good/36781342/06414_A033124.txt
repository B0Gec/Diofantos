 68.5 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A033124: 
a(n) = -6*a(n - 11) + a(n - 10) + 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 37, a(3) = 223

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
