While total time consumed by now, scale:601/34371, seq_id:A004445, order:20 took:
 43.6 seconds, i.e. 0.73 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A004445: 
a(n) = -a(n - 20) + a(n - 16) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 0, a(5) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
