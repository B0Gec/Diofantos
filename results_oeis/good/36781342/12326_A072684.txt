A072684: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 3*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 31, a(4) = 103

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
