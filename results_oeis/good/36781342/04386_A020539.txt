 87.7 seconds, i.e. 1.46 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A020539: 
a(n) = 512*a(n - 3) - 336*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 1) + -336*a(n - 2) + 512*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 362, a(2) = 15124

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
