While total time consumed by now, scale:3196/34371, seq_id:A016296, order:20 took:
 68.6 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A016296: 
a(n) = 70*a(n - 5) + 11*a(n - 4) + 25*a(n - 3) - 46*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -59*a(n - 2) + 70*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 137

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
