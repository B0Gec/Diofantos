 85.7 seconds, i.e. 1.43 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A266973: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 16, a(3) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
