 49.7 seconds, i.e. 0.83 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A090401: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 7) - a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
