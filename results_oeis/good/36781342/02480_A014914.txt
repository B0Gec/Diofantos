 48.4 seconds, i.e. 0.81 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A014914: 
a(n) = 2*n + 25*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -51*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 678

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
