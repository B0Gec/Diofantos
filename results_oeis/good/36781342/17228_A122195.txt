 96.8 seconds, i.e. 1.61 minutes or 0.027 hours.

A122195: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8) + -1*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 11, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 14, a(4) = 18, a(5) = 19, a(6) = 22, a(7) = 23, a(8) = 30

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
