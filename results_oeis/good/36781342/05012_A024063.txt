While total time consumed by now, scale:5013/34371, seq_id:A024063, order:20 took:
 52.8 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A024063: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) - 6*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 1) + -13*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 34

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
