While total time consumed by now, scale:12945/34371, seq_id:A078100, order:20 took:
 68.1 seconds, i.e. 1.13 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A078100: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 6) - 3*a(n - 5) - 9*a(n - 4) - 7*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 7*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 187

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
