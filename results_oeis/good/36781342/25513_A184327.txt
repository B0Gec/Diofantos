 64.3 seconds, i.e. 1.07 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A184327: 
a(n) = a(n - 8) - 6*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) - a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 97, a(3) = 577

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
