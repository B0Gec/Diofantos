 73.3 seconds, i.e. 1.22 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A280111: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 38*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 38*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 39*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 58, a(2) = 2221

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
