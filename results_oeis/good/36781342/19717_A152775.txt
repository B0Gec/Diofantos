 45.1 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A152775: 
a(n) = -1000*a(n - 7) + a(n - 6) + 1000*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 111, a(1) = 111000, a(2) = 111000111

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
