While total time consumed by now, scale:2495/34371, seq_id:A014928, order:20 took:
 72.5 seconds, i.e. 1.21 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A014928: 
a(n) = 169*a(n - 7) - 26*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 169*a(n - 2) + 26*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 1) + -195*a(n - 2) + 169*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 534

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
