While total time consumed by now, scale:27966/34371, seq_id:A225813, order:20 took:
 111.6 seconds, i.e. 1.86 minutes or 0.031 hours.

A225813: 
a(n) = 1000*a(n - 14) - 110*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 1000*a(n - 2) + 110*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 111*a(n - 1) + -1110*a(n - 2) + 1000*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 171, a(2) = 10701

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
