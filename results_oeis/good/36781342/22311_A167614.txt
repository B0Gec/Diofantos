While total time consumed by now, scale:22312/34371, seq_id:A167614, order:20 took:
 72.0 seconds, i.e. 1.2 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A167614: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 13

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
