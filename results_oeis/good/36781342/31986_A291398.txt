A291398: 
a(n) = -a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 9, a(5) = 19

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
