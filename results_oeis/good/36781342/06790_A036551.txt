While total time consumed by now, scale:6791/34371, seq_id:A036551, order:20 took:
 107.1 seconds, i.e. 1.78 minutes or 0.03 hours.

A036551: 
a(n) = 12*a(n - 11) - 8*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) - 12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 9*a(n - 1) + -20*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
