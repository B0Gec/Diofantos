 37.5 seconds, i.e. 0.62 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A037626: 
a(n) = -3*n + a(n - 19) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 13, a(2) = 65, a(3) = 327

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
