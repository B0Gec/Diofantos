 39.2 seconds, i.e. 0.65 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A108014: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
