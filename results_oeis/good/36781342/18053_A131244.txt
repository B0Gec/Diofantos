 40.8 seconds, i.e. 0.68 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A131244: 
a(n) = -a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -3*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 14

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
