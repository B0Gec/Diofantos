A327961: 
a(n) = -256*a(n - 5) + 32*a(n - 4) + 176*a(n - 3) - 94*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 18*a(n - 1) + -112*a(n - 2) + 288*a(n - 3) + -256*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 13, a(3) = 122

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
