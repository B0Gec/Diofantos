While total time consumed by now, scale:26389/34371, seq_id:A198410, order:20 took:
 60.4 seconds, i.e. 1.01 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A198410: 
a(n) = 27*a(n - 7) - 12*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 27*a(n - 2) + 12*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 13*a(n - 1) + -39*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 37, a(2) = 271

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
