While total time consumed by now, scale:31432/34371, seq_id:A286186, order:20 took:
 71.0 seconds, i.e. 1.18 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A286186: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 17) - a(n - 16) - 4*a(n - 12) + a(n - 11) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 7, a(1) = 22, a(2) = 73

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
