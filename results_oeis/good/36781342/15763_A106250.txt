While total time consumed by now, scale:15764/34371, seq_id:A106250, order:20 took:
 73.1 seconds, i.e. 1.22 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A106250: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 9)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
