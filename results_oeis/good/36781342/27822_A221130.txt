While total time consumed by now, scale:27823/34371, seq_id:A221130, order:20 took:
 132.0 seconds, i.e. 2.2 minutes or 0.037 hours.

A221130: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 8) - a(n - 7) - 4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 10, a(2) = 35

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
