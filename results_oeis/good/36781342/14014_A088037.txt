While total time consumed by now, scale:14015/34371, seq_id:A088037, order:20 took:
 37.9 seconds, i.e. 0.63 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A088037: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - 8*a(n - 4) - 2*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -14*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
