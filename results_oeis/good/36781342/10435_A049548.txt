 63.8 seconds, i.e. 1.06 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A049548: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
