 70.1 seconds, i.e. 1.17 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A158879: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 4*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) - 4*a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -9*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 18

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
