 55.2 seconds, i.e. 0.92 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A007068: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 6) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 4*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
