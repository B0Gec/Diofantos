While total time consumed by now, scale:25198/34371, seq_id:A179259, order:20 took:
 66.1 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A179259: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 52, a(3) = 140

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
