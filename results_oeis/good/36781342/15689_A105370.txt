While total time consumed by now, scale:15690/34371, seq_id:A105370, order:20 took:
 85.9 seconds, i.e. 1.43 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A105370: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 7) + a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) - 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 1) + -10*a(n - 2) + -10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = -2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
