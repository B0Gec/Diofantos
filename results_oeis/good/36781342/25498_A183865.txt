While total time consumed by now, scale:25499/34371, seq_id:A183865, order:20 took:
 61.0 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A183865: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + -2*a(n - 6) + 1*a(n - 7),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 19, a(5) = 27, a(6) = 36

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
