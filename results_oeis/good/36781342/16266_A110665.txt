While total time consumed by now, scale:16267/34371, seq_id:A110665, order:20 took:
 78.3 seconds, i.e. 1.3 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A110665: 
a(n) = a(n - 20) - a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) - a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 0, a(3) = -3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
