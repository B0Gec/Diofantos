A042191: 
a(n) = -a(n - 8) + 498*a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 498*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 0*a(n - 6) + 0*a(n - 7) + -1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 489, a(5) = 499, a(6) = 4481, a(7) = 4980

True  -  checked against website ground truth.
