 59.4 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A014909: 
a(n) = 2*n + 23*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 1) + -47*a(n - 2) + 23*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 25, a(2) = 578

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
