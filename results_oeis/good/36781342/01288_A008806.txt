While total time consumed by now, scale:1289/34371, seq_id:A008806, order:20 took:
 65.6 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A008806: 
a(n) = a(n - 15) - a(n - 13) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
