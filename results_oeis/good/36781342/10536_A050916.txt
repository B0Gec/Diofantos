 84.9 seconds, i.e. 1.42 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A050916: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 7) - 10*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 25*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 11*a(n - 1) + -35*a(n - 2) + 25*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 51

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
