 66.0 seconds, i.e. 1.1 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A281500: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 10) + a(n - 8) + 4*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 5*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -4*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 14, a(3) = 15

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
