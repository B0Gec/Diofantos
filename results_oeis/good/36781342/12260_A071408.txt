While total time consumed by now, scale:12261/34371, seq_id:A071408, order:20 took:
 61.4 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A071408: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 7, a(4) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
