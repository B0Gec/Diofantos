While total time consumed by now, scale:17135/34371, seq_id:A121302, order:20 took:
 43.8 seconds, i.e. 0.73 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A121302: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 3*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 4*a(n - 4) - 3*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 4*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 10, a(4) = 28

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
