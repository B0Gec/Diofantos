While total time consumed by now, scale:3145/34371, seq_id:A016241, order:20 took:
 59.4 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A016241: 
a(n) = 42*a(n - 7) - 13*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - 42*a(n - 2) + 13*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 14*a(n - 1) + -55*a(n - 2) + 42*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 14, a(2) = 141

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
