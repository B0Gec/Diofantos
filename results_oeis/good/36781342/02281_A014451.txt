While total time consumed by now, scale:2282/34371, seq_id:A014451, order:20 took:
 47.5 seconds, i.e. 0.79 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A014451: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) - a(n - 18) + a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) - a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
