 61.1 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A001971: 
a(n) = n - a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 1, a(4) = 2, a(5) = 3

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
