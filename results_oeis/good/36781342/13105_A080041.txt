While total time consumed by now, scale:13106/34371, seq_id:A080041, order:20 took:
 36.0 seconds, i.e. 0.6 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A080041: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 20

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
