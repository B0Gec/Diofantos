While total time consumed by now, scale:25632/34371, seq_id:A187093, order:20 took:
 76.8 seconds, i.e. 1.28 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A187093: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
