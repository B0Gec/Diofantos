 40.2 seconds, i.e. 0.67 minutes or 0.011 hours.

A100059: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
