While total time consumed by now, scale:24426/34371, seq_id:A171218, order:20 took:
 78.1 seconds, i.e. 1.3 minutes or 0.022 hours.

A171218: 
a(n) = -a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 12) - a(n - 9) - a(n - 7) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 16, a(4) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
