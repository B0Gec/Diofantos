While total time consumed by now, scale:24632/34371, seq_id:A173391, order:20 took:
 73.3 seconds, i.e. 1.22 minutes or 0.02 hours.

A173391: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) - 3*a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 5*a(n - 1) + -7*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 9, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 45

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
