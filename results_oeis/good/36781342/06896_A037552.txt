 54.9 seconds, i.e. 0.91 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A037552: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -3*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 68

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
