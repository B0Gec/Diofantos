A108155: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 10) + 3*a(n - 5)
truth: 
a(n) = -1*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 8) + 2*a(n - 9),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 2, a(4) = 3, a(5) = 4, a(6) = 5, a(7) = 6, a(8) = 7

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
