While total time consumed by now, scale:21535/34371, seq_id:A164448, order:20 took:
 75.0 seconds, i.e. 1.25 minutes or 0.021 hours.

A164448: 
a(n) = a(n - 10) - a(n - 7) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 13, a(1) = 21, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 51, a(4) = 77, a(5) = 116

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
