A178147: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 15) + a(n - 4)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + 1*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 6) + 2*a(n - 7) + 1*a(n - 8),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 25, a(5) = 13, a(6) = 0, a(7) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
