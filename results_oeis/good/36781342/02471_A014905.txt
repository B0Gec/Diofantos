 53.4 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A014905: 
a(n) = 2*n + 21*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 23*a(n - 1) + -43*a(n - 2) + 21*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 23, a(2) = 486

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
