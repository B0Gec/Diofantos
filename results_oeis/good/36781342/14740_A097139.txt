 69.2 seconds, i.e. 1.15 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A097139: 
a(n) = n - 5*a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + 5*a(n - 10) + 4*a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + -6*a(n - 3) + 5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
