 68.4 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A256233: 
a(n) = a(n - 6) - 2*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -4*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 9

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
