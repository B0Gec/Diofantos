While total time consumed by now, scale:14710/34371, seq_id:A097066, order:20 took:
 85.3 seconds, i.e. 1.42 minutes or 0.024 hours.

A097066: 
a(n) = a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 2

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
