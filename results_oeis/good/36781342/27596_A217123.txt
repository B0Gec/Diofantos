While total time consumed by now, scale:27597/34371, seq_id:A217123, order:20 took:
 52.5 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A217123: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 10

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
