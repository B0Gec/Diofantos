 47.5 seconds, i.e. 0.79 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A033120: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 5, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
