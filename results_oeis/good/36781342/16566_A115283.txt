While total time consumed by now, scale:16567/34371, seq_id:A115283, order:20 took:
 63.3 seconds, i.e. 1.05 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A115283: 
a(n) = a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) - a(n - 12) + a(n - 6) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 13, a(4) = 18, a(5) = 27

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
