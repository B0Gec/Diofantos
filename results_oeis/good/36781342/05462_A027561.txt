 58.3 seconds, i.e. 0.97 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A027561: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 5) + 3*a(n - 4) - 11*a(n - 3) + 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -11*a(n - 3) + 3*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0, a(4) = 0

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
