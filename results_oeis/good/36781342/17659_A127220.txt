 65.7 seconds, i.e. 1.09 minutes or 0.018 hours.

A127220: 
a(n) = 81*a(n - 4) + 27*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 27*a(n - 3) + 81*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 27, a(2) = 189, a(3) = 1215

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
