A215139: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 10) - 7*a(n - 8) - 8*a(n - 4) + 6*a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 7*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + -14*a(n - 4) + 0*a(n - 5) + 7*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 5, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 17, a(4) = 91, a(5) = 69

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
