 83.1 seconds, i.e. 1.38 minutes or 0.023 hours.

A229354: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 18) + a(n - 17) - 4*a(n - 16) + a(n - 15) - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -11*a(n - 2) + 6*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 17

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
