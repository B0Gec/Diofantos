 46.6 seconds, i.e. 0.78 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A135466: 
a(n) = 8*a(n - 6) + 4*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 5*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 6*a(n - 1) + -12*a(n - 2) + 8*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 8, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 8

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
