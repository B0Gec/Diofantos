 34.8 seconds, i.e. 0.58 minutes or 0.01 hours.

A037765: 
a(n) = -4*a(n - 13) + a(n - 12) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -4*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 3, a(1) = 12, a(2) = 50, a(3) = 201, a(4) = 807

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
