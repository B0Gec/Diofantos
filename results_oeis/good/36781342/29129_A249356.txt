 52.5 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A249356: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 6) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 2)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + -1*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 33, a(3) = 49, a(4) = 65, a(5) = 97

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
