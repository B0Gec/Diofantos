While total time consumed by now, scale:195/34371, seq_id:A001312, order:20 took:
 45.0 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A001312: 
a(n) = n - a(n - 18) - a(n - 15) + a(n - 13) + a(n - 10) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
