 53.4 seconds, i.e. 0.89 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A128439: 
a(n) = a(n - 12) + 2*a(n - 11) - 2*a(n - 7) - 2*a(n - 5) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -4*a(n - 3) + -2*a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 5) + 1*a(n - 6),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 27, a(4) = 55, a(5) = 107

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
