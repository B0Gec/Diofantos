 61.4 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A253120: 
a(n) = a(n - 7) - 98*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 2) + 98*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 99*a(n - 1) + -99*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 705, a(2) = 69196

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
