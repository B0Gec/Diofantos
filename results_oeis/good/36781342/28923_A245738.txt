 46.5 seconds, i.e. 0.78 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A245738: 
a(n) = -a(n - 10) - a(n - 9) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 2*a(n - 2) + -1*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 7, a(3) = 11

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
