While total time consumed by now, scale:17205/34371, seq_id:A122058, order:20 took:
 68.2 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A122058: 
a(n) = -12*a(n - 6) + a(n - 5) - a(n - 4) + 2*a(n - 3) + 10*a(n - 2) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 11*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + -12*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 5, a(2) = 22, a(3) = 84

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
