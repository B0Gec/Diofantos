 45.5 seconds, i.e. 0.76 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A290651: 
a(n) = 4*n - 6*a(n - 3) - a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 4, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 26

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
