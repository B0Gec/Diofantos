While total time consumed by now, scale:5087/34371, seq_id:A024206, order:20 took:
 55.7 seconds, i.e. 0.93 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A024206: 
a(n) = a(n - 14) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
