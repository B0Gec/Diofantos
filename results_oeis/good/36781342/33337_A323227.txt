While total time consumed by now, scale:33338/34371, seq_id:A323227, order:20 took:
 57.8 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A323227: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) - 2*a(n - 9) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 7) + 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -5*a(n - 2) + 2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
