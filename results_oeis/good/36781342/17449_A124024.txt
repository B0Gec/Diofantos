 52.9 seconds, i.e. 0.88 minutes or 0.015 hours.

A124024: 
a(n) = -5*a(n - 4) + 10*a(n - 3) + 9*a(n - 2) - 2*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -2*a(n - 1) + 9*a(n - 2) + 10*a(n - 3) + -5*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 13, a(3) = -34

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
