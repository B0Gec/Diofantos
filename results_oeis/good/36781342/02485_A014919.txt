While total time consumed by now, scale:2486/34371, seq_id:A014919, order:20 took:
 44.7 seconds, i.e. 0.75 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A014919: 
a(n) = -a(n - 17) + a(n - 16) - a(n - 15) + a(n - 14) - a(n - 13) - a(n - 10) + a(n - 9) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = *a(n - 1),  
a(0) = 2017

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
