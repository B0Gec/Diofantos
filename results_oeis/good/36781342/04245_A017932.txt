 57.2 seconds, i.e. 0.95 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A017932: 
a(n) = 144*a(n - 3) - 90*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -90*a(n - 2) + 144*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 199

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
