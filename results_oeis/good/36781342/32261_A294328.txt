While total time consumed by now, scale:32262/34371, seq_id:A294328, order:20 took:
 51.9 seconds, i.e. 0.87 minutes or 0.014 hours.

A294328: 
a(n) = 100*a(n - 15) - 20*a(n - 14) + a(n - 13) - 100*a(n - 2) + 20*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 21*a(n - 1) + -120*a(n - 2) + 100*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 32

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
