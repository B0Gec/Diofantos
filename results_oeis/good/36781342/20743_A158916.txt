 45.5 seconds, i.e. 0.76 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A158916: 
a(n) = 2*a(n - 6) - a(n - 5) + a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) + a(n - 2) - a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = -3*a(n - 1) + -3*a(n - 2) + -2*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
