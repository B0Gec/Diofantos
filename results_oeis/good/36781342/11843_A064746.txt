 59.6 seconds, i.e. 0.99 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A064746: 
a(n) = 64*a(n - 4) - 16*a(n - 3) - 63*a(n - 2) + 16*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 17*a(n - 1) + -80*a(n - 2) + 64*a(n - 3),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 9, a(2) = 129

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
