While total time consumed by now, scale:14694/34371, seq_id:A096957, order:20 took:
 57.9 seconds, i.e. 0.96 minutes or 0.016 hours.

A096957: 
a(n) = -a(n - 19) + a(n - 18) + a(n - 14) - a(n - 11) - a(n - 8) + a(n - 5) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 4*a(n - 1) + -6*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 6, a(1) = 19, a(2) = 40, a(3) = 70

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
