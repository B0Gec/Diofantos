 61.5 seconds, i.e. 1.02 minutes or 0.017 hours.

A292493: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + 11*a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 3*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) + -2*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = -1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 25

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
