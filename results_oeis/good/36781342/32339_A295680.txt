 48.4 seconds, i.e. 0.81 minutes or 0.013 hours.

A295680: 
a(n) = a(n - 4) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 2

True  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
