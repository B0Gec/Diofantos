While total time consumed by now, scale:16428/34371, seq_id:A113437, order:20 took:
 68.6 seconds, i.e. 1.14 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A113437: 
a(n) = -a(n - 7) + 9*a(n - 6) + 5*a(n - 5) - 2*a(n - 4) - 6*a(n - 3) - 3*a(n - 2) + 5*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 3) + -1*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(2) = 11, a(3) = 41

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
