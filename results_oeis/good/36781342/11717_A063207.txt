 41.9 seconds, i.e. 0.7 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A063207: 
a(n) = -a(n - 13) + a(n - 7) + a(n - 6)
truth: 
a(n) = 0*a(n - 1) + 1*a(n - 2) + 1*a(n - 3) + 0*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 6, a(2) = 8, a(3) = 12, a(4) = 14

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
