 69.6 seconds, i.e. 1.16 minutes or 0.019 hours.

A249999: 
a(n) = 3*n - 6*a(n - 4) - a(n - 3) - 2*a(n - 2) + 4*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 7*a(n - 1) + -17*a(n - 2) + 17*a(n - 3) + -6*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 1, a(1) = 7, a(2) = 32, a(3) = 122

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
