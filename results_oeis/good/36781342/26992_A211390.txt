 42.7 seconds, i.e. 0.71 minutes or 0.012 hours.

A211390: 
a(n) = -a(n - 11) + a(n - 8) + a(n - 3)
truth: 
a(n) = 1*a(n - 1) + 0*a(n - 2) + 0*a(n - 3) + 1*a(n - 4) + -1*a(n - 5),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 4, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 6

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
False  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
